abandon: v.tointentionally and
permanently give up,surrender,
leave, desert orrelinquish allin-
terest orownership inproperty, a
home orother premises, aright of
way,andeven aspouse, family, or
children. Theword isoften used in
situations todetermine whether a
tenant has lefthis/her apartment
andtheproperty inside anddoes
notintend tocome back. Thus, a
landlord cantake overanappar-
ently abandoned residence, but
must store anything atenant
leaves behind andgive notice to
thetenant before selling thepos-
sessions which are left.Toaban-
donchildren canmean tohaveno
contact andgivenosupport fora
year ormore. (See:abandoned
property, abandonment)
abandoned property: n.property
leftbehind (often byatenant) in-
tentionally andpermanently when
itappears that theformer owner
(ortenant) doesnotintend tocome
back, pick itup,oruse it.Examples
may include possessions leftina
house after thetenant hasmoved
outorautos leftbeside aroad fora
longperiod oftime, orpatent rights
ofaninventor whodoes notapply
forapatent andletsothers usehis
invention without protest. One
mayhaveabandoned theproperty
ofcontract rights bynotdoingwhat
isrequired bythecontract. Howev-
er,aneasement andother land
rights arenotabandoned property
just because ofnon-use. (See:
abandon, abandonment)abandonment: n.theactofintention-
allyandpermanently giving up,sur-
rendering, deserting orrelinquishing
property, premises, aright ofway, a
ship, contract rights, aspouse and/or
children. Abandonment ofaspouse
means intent atpermanent separa-
tion,andwith children alengthy peri-
odofneither contact noranysupport.
Inmaritime lawabandonment hasa
special meaning: when anowner sur-
renders ashipand itscontents toa
trustee forthebenefit ofclaimants,
particularly after awreck. Ifone in-
vents something anddoes notgeta
patent butallows others tousethein-
vention ordedicates ittopublic use,
theright topatent isprobably aban-
doned. Confusion arises over aban-
donment ofwater rights, mining
rights, orrights ofway, since mere
non-use isnotsufficient toshow aban-
donment. (See: abandon, aban-
doned property, patent)
abate: v.todoaway with aproblem,
such asapublic orprivate nuisance or
some structure builtcontrary topublic
policy. Thiscaninclude dikeswhich il-
legally direct water onto aneighbor’s
property, highvolume noise from a
rockband orafactory, animprove-
ment constructed inviolation ofbuild-
ingandsafety codes, orseepage froma
faulty septic tank. (See:abatement)
abatement: n.1)theremoval ofaprob-
lemwhich isagainst public orprivate

nuisances such asweeds thatmight
catch fireonanotherwise empty lot;
2)anequal reduction ofrecovery of

arenotenough funds orassets to
paythefullamount; 3)anequal re-
duction ofbenefits tobeneficiaries
(heirs) when anestate isnotlarge
enough topayeach beneficiary in
full. (See:abate)
abduction: n.thecriminal taking
away ofaperson bypersuasion
(convincing someone—particularly
aminor orawoman—he/she isbet-
teroffleaving with thepersuader),
byfraud (telling theperson he/she is
needed, orthatthemother orfather
wants him/her tocome with theab-
ductor), orbyopen force orviolence.
Originally abduction applied only to
protect women andchildren asvic-
tims. Currently inmost states itcan
alsoapply toanadult male. Infact,
insome states likeNewYork ab-
duction meant theunlawful taking
ordetention ofanyfemale forpur-
poses of“marriage, concubinage or
prostitution.” Kidnapping ismore
limited, requiring force, threat of
forceuponanadult orthetaking of
children. (See:kidnapping)

Itisoften used todescribe aperson
ascapable ofearning aliving and,
therefore, ofpaying alimony or
child support.
abortion: n.thetermination ofpreg-
nancy byvarious means, including
medical surgery, before thefetus is
able tosustain independent life.Until
1973 abortion wasconsidered acrime
(bythemother andthedoctor) unless
performed byphysicians toprotect the
lifeofthemother, aphrase often
broadly interpreted. Untrained per-
sons performed thousands ofabor-
tions each year intheU.S. using
hasty, unsanitary anddangerous
means, resulting inmaiming, perma-
nentdamage oforgans, anddeath
ofmany women. TheSupreme Court
ruled inthecaseofRoe v.Wade (1973)
thatawoman hadtheright tochoose
abortion toendapregnancy through
the first trimester (three months)
ofgestation. Inthe latter stages
ofpregnancy, danger tothe lifeofthe
mother could still justify alegal
abortion. Political struggles followed
over legalized abortions. Some state
19

abrogate
legislatures passed limitations such
asrequiring teenage girls toobtain
their parents’ consent inorder to
getanabortion. Despite appoint-
ment ofanti-abortion justices by
Presidents Reagan andBush, the
Supreme Court hasnotover-turned
thebasicWade case rule.President
BillClinton’s appointments areex-
pected tomake legalized abortion
continue inthefuture.
abrogate: v.toannul orrepeal alaw
orpass legislation that contradicts
theprior law.Abrogate alsoapplies
torevoking orwithdrawing condi-
tions ofacontract. (See:repeal)

suit(judgment creditor), therateofin-
terest tobepaidonthejudgment
amount, court costs, andany specific
orders thatthelosing party (judgment
debtor) must obey, which abstract is
acknowledged andstamped sothat it
can berecorded atthecounty

judgment istocreate apublic record
andcreate alienorclaim ifnecessary
onanyrealestate owned orlater ac-
quired bytheloser located inthe
county inwhich theabstract ofjudg-
ment isrecorded. Iftheloser doesnot
paythejudgment voluntarily thenthe
winner canforce asheriffs saleofany
property tocollect. There areseveral
problems: a)tofindthecounty where
theloserowns realestate; b)theprob-
ability that there aresecured loans,
taxliens and/or otherjudgments that
come ahead ofthejudgment lien; c)
the possibility that theloser/debtor
maygobankrupt andavoid paying
thedebt. (See: levy, lien)
abstract oftitle: n.thewritten report
onatitle search which shows the
history ofevery change ofownership
onapiece ofreal estate, andany
claims against theproperty, such
aseasements ontheproperty, loans
against it,deeds oftrust, mortgages,
liens, judgments, and realproperty
taxes.Some abstracts onlygoback in
history tothelastchange intitle.
Insome places theabstract oftitle
isprepared byatitlecompany,
andinother places byanindividual
who iscalled anabstractor. Most
buyers and alllenders require the
title report with anabstract. The

abuse ofdiscretion: n.apoliteway
ofsaying atrialjudge hasmade
such abadmistake (“clearly against

tablished law)during atrial oron
ruling onamotion thataperson did
notgetafair trial.Acourt ofap-
peals willuseafinding ofthisabuse
asareason toreverse thetrialcourt

discretion” orjudges’ mistakes in-
clude notallowing animportant
witness totestify, making improper
comments thatmight influence a
jury, showing bias, ormaking rul-
ingsonevidence thatdenyaperson
achance totellhisorhersideofthe
matter. This does notmean atrial
orthejudge hastobeperfect, but it
doesmean thatthejudge’s actions
were sofaroutofbounds thatsome-
onetruly didnotgetafair trial.
Sometimes theappeals courts admit
thejudgewaswrong, butnotwrong
enough tohave influenced theout-
come ofthetrial, often totheannoy-
anceofthelosing party. Incriminal
cases abuse ofdiscretion caninclude
sentences that are grossly too
harsh. Inadivorce action, itin-
cludes awarding alimony way be-
yond theestablished formula orthe
spouse’s orlifepartner’s realistic
ability topay.
abuse ofprocess: n.theuseoflegal
process byillegal, malicious, or
perverted means. Examples in-
clude serving (officially giving) a
complaint tosomeone when ithasnot actually been filed, just to
intimidate anenemy; filing afalse
declaration ofservice (filing apaper
untruthfully stating aliethatsome-
onehasofficially given anotice toan-

acceleration: n.1)speeding upthe
timewhen there isvesting (absolute
ownership) ofaninterest inanestate,
when theinterest infront ofitister-
minated earlier than expected; 2)ina
contract orpromissory note,when the
payment ofdebt ismoved uptothe
present timedue tosome event like
non-payment ofaninstallment orsale
oftheproperty which secures thedebt.
(See:acceleration clause, vest)
acceleration clause: n.aprovision ina
contract orpromissory note that if
some specified event (likenotmaking
payments ontime) occurs thentheen-
tireamount isdueorother require-
ments areduenow, pronto. This
clause ismost oftenfound inpromisso-
rynotes with installment payments
forpurchase ofrealproperty and re-
quires that iftheproperty issoldthen
theentire amount ofthenote isdue
immediately (theso-called “dueonsale
21

accept
clause”). Some states prohibit “due
onsale”andalways allow thenew
property owner toassume thedebt.
(See:acceleration, assumption)
accept: v.toreceive something with
approval andintention tokeep it.
Thisuseoften arises onthequestion
ofaccepting apayment which islate
ornotcomplete oraccepting the
“service” (delivery) oflegal papers.
acceptance: n.1)receiving some-
thing from another with theintent
tokeep it,andshowing that this
wasbased onaprevious agreement.
2)agreeing verbally orinwriting to
theterms ofacontract, which isone
oftherequirements toshow there
wasacontract (anofferandanac-
ceptance ofthat offer).Awritten
offercanbeaccepted only inwrit-
ing.3)receiving goods with thein-
tention ofpaying forthem ifasale
hasbeenagreed to.4)agreement to
payabillofexchange, which canbe
an“absolute acceptance” (topayas
the bill iswritten) or“conditional
acceptance” (topayonlywhensome
condition actually occurs such as
theshipment ordelivery ofcertain
goods). “Acceptance” ismost often
used inthefactual determination of
whether acontract was entered
into. (See:contract, offer)
acceptance ofservice: n.agreement
byadefendant (orhis/her attorney)
inalegal action toaccept acom-
plaint orother petition (like divorce
papers) without having thesheriff or
process server showupatthedoor.
Theagreement of“acceptance ofser-
vice”must beinwriting orthere is
noproof that ithappened. Inmost
jurisdictions there isaform entitled“receipt andacknowledgment ofaccep-
tance ofservice” orsimilar language
which must besigned, dated andsent
back totheattorney whosentthecom-
plaint orpetition. Attorneys must be
careful thattheyhave legal authority
fromaclient toactonhis/her behalf,
because aclientmaydeny later that
he/she gave authority toaccept ser-
vice. (See: service)
access: n.1)inrealestate therightand
ability togettotheproperty. 2)when a
husband hastheopportunity tomake
lovetohiswife, itissaidhehasaccess.
Thisrather vulgar useof“access” has
been important because ifahusband
“had access” tohiswifeduring the
timewhen shebecame pregnant, itis
presumed heisthefather.Modem use
ofblood testsandDNA studies may
show thefather tobesomeone other
than thehusband whether thehus-
band “had access” ornot. (See:DNA,
egress, paternity suit)
accessory: n.asecond-string player
who helps inthecommission ofa
crime bydriving thegetaway car,pro-
viding theweapons, assisting inthe
planning, providing analibi, orhiding
theprincipal offender after thecrime.
Usually theaccessory isnotimmedi-
ately present during thecrime, but
must beaware thatthecrime isgoing
tobecommitted orhasbeencommit-
ted.Usually anaccessory’s punish-
ment islessthanthatofthemain per-
petrator, butatough jury orjudge
may findtheaccessory justasrespon-
sible. (See:aidandabet)
accommodation: n.1)afavor done
without compensation (pay orcon-

accomplice: n.someone who assists
inthecommission ofacrime and,
unlike amere accessory, isusually
present ordirectly aids inthe
crime (like holding agunonthe

accord and satisfaction: n.an
agreement toaccept lessthan is
legally dueinorder towrapupthe
matter. Once theaccord and satis-
faction ismade and theamount
paid (even though itislessthan
owed) thedebt iswiped outsince
thenewagreement (accord) and
payment (the satisfaction) replaces
theoriginal obligation. Itisoften
usedbycreditors as“abird inthe
hand isworth twointhebush” prac-
ticality. (See:novation)
account stated: n.astatement be-
tween acreditor ortheperson to
whom money isowedandadebtor
(theperson whoowes) thatapartic-
ularamount isowed totheseller as
ofacertain date. Often theaccountstated isabill,invoice orasummary
ofinvoices, signed bythecustomer or
sent tothecustomer whopays partor
allofitwithout protest. This isimpor-
tantwhen afrustrated businessman
sues for“account stated” which sets
both the debtor’s liability andthe
exact amount thedebtor must pay,
which islesscomplicated than claim-
ingadebt isdueandpayable. Anac-
count stated may carry alonger
statute oflimitations (time tofilesuit)

accounts payable: n.bills that are
owed. (See:debt)
accounts receivable: n.theamounts

wasmeant tobecause another ben-
eficiary orheir dies orrejects the
gift.Example: ifabrother and sis-
terweresupposed todivide ashare
ofDad’s estate, butbrother doesn’t
want it,then sister’s share grows
byaccretion. 3)intrusts, accretion
occurs when abeneficiary gets a
surprising increase inbenefits due
toanunexpected event. (See: pro-
bate, trust)
accrue: v.1)growing oradding to,
such asinterest onadebt orin-
vestment which continues toaccu-
mulate. 2)thecoming intobeing of
theright tobring alawsuit. Forex-
ample, theright tosueonacon-
tract only accrues when thecon-
tract isbreached (notonmere sus-
picion that itmight bebreached) or
when theother party repudiates
thecontract (anticipatory breach).
accusation: n.1)inlegalterms ac-
cusation means officially charging
someone withacrime either byin-
dictment byaGrand Jury orfiling
charges byaDistrict Attorney. 2)in
layterms anyclaim ofwrongdoing
byanother person.
accused: n.aperson charged with
acrime.
acknowledge: v.1)generally to
admit something, whether bad,
good orindifferent. 2)toverify toa
notary public orother officer (such
asaCounty Clerk) thatthesigner
executed (wrote, signed) thedocu-
ment likeadeed, lease, orpower
ofattorney, tomake itcertified aslegal and suitable forrecording.
(See:acknowledgment)
acknowledgment: n.thesection atthe
endofadocument where anotary
public verifies thatthesigner ofthe
document states he/she actually
signed it.Typical language is:“State

putsonhis/her seal,which isusually
arubber stamp, although some still
useametal seal.Theperson acknowl-
edging that he/she signed must be
ready toproduce adriver’s license or
other proof ofexistence, andmust sign
thenotary’s journal. Theacknowledg-

powers ofattorney thatmay involve
real estate, some leases andvarious
other papers.

action: n.alawsuit inwhich one
party (orparties) suessmother. (See:
cause ofaction, lawsuit)
actionable: adj.when enough facts
orcircumstances exist tomeet the
legal requirements tofilealegiti-
mate lawsuit. Ifthefacts required
toprove acasecannot bealleged in
thecomplaint, thecase isnot“ac-
tionable” andtheclient andhis/her
attorney should not fileasuit.Of
course, whether many cases areac-
tionable isamatter ofjudgment and
interpretation ofthe facts and/or
law,resulting inmany lawsuits that
clogthecourts. Incidentally, ifa
case isfiledwhich isclearly notac-
tionable, itmay result inalawsuit
against thefileroftheoriginal suit
formalicious prosecution bythede-
fendant after he/she haswon the
original suit. (See:cause ofaction,
lawsuit, malicious prosecution)
actofGod: n.anatural catastrophe
which noonecanprevent suchasan
earthquake, atidalwave, avolcanic
eruption, ahurricane oratornado.
Acts ofGodaresignificant fortwo
reasons: 1)forthehavoc anddam-
agethey wreak, and 2)because
often contracts state that “acts of
God” areanexcuse fordelay orfail-
uretofulfill acommitment orto
complete aconstruction project.
Many insurance policies exempt
coverage fordamage caused byacts
ofGod, which isonetime aninsurance company gets religion. At
times disputes arise astowhether a
violent storm orother disaster wasan
actofGod(and therefore exempt from
aclaim) oraforeseeable natural
event. Godknows theanswer!
actual controversy: n.atrue legal dis-
putewhich leads toagenuine lawsuit
rather thanmerely a“cooked up”legal
action filed togetacourt togivethe
equivalent ofanadvisory opinion.
Federal courts, including theU.S.
Supreme Court, willonlyconsider an
“actual controversy”, onappeal, since
they willnotgiveadvisory (informal)
opinions ormake judgments on
“friendly suits” filed totestthepoten-
tialoutcome. (See:friendly suit)
actual notice: n.having beeninformed
directly ofsomething orhaving seen it
occur, asdistinguisned from construc-
tivenotice (e.g.anotice wasmailed
butnotreceived, published inanews-
paper, orplaced inofficial records).
(See: notice)
addendum: n.anaddition toacom-
pleted written document. Most com-
monly this isaproposed change orex-
planation (such asalistofgoods tobe
included) inacontract, orsome point
thathasbeen thesubject ofnegotia-
tion after thecontract wasoriginally
proposed byoneparty. Real property
salesagreements oftenhaveaddenda
(plural ofaddendum) asthebuyer
and seller negotiate finepoints (how
payments willbemade, what appli-
ances willbeincluded, date oftrans-
feroftitle, theterms offinancing by
the seller and the like). Although
often theyarenot,addenda should be
signed separately andattached tothe
original agreement sothatthere will

drafts orunaccepted proposals or
included fraudulently.
adeem: v.torevoke agiftmade ina
willbydestroying, selling orgiving
away thegiftitemduring the life-
time ofthetestator (writer ofthe

his/her will, “Ileavemysonmy
1988 Cadillac automobile” andthen
Dad totals orsells thecar.Nasty
legal fights canarise ifthesupposed
adeemed gift isnotclearly identi-
fied,asin“IgiveRobertmyfamily

adequate remedy: n.aremedy
(money orperformance) awarded
byacourt orthrough private ac-
tion(including compromise) which
affords “complete” satisfaction,
and is“practical, efficient andap-
propriate” inthecircumstances. In
part thisdepends onwhat relief
(likeanorder granting onean
easement overaneighbor’s proper-
tyoranorder keeping thedrunken
husband away from thecomplain-
ingwife) aparty isseeking. A
court isabitself-congratulatory
andsubjectively judgmental when
itannounces that theremedygranted is“adequate” when ithas

While afairand responsible ad-
juster canserve arealpurpose in
getting information andevaluating
thecase fortheinsurance company,
some adjusters trytomake asettle-
ment before theinjured person has
retained anattorney (“don’t worry,we’llpayyour bills.Youdon’tneedan
attorney. He’ll onlyconfuse things.”),
getastatement from theinjured with-
outcounsel, ordelay thepayout with
thepromise he/she willnegotiate any
reasonable demand, andthenmaking
anoffer ofpayment that isabsurdly
low.Some insurance companies tryto
make theattorney dealwith thead-

adlitem adj.legalLatinmeaning “forthe
purposes ofthelegal action only.” Most
often theterm applies toaparent who
filesalawsuit forhisorherminor child
as“guardian atlitem” (guardian justfor
thepurposes ofthelawsuit) orforaper-
sonwho isincompetent. Either atthe
timethelawsuit isfiledorshortly there-
after, theparent petitions thecourt to
allow him/her tobeguardian adlitem,
which isbrought exparte (without ano-
ticed hearing) and isalmost always
granted. Aperson acting adlitem has
theresponsibility topursue thelawsuit
andtoaccount forthemoney recovered
fordamages. Ifachild insuchalawsuit
reaches majority (18inmost states)
while thesuit ispending, theadlitem
guardianship terminates andthe“new”
adult canrun his/her own lawsuit.
Some courts require anorder terminat-
ingtheguardianship adlitem upon
proof ofcoming ofage. (See:guardian

administrative hearing
administrative hearing: n.ahear-
ing before any governmental
agency orbefore anadministrative
lawjudge. Such hearings can
range from simple arguments to
whatamounts toatrial. There is
nojury, buttheagency orthead-
ministrative lawjudge willmake a
ruling. (See:administrative law,
hearing)
administrative law: n.theproce-
dures created byadministrative
agencies (governmental bodies of
thecity,county, state orfederal gov-
ernment) involving rules, regula-
tions, applications, licenses, per-
mits, available information, hear-
ings, appeals anddecision-making.
Federal agency procedures aregov-
erned bytheAdministrative Proce-
dure Act,andmany states have
adopted similar procedural formats
either bylaworregulation. Itisim-
portant toconsider twovital factors
indealing withadministrative agen-
cies: 1)therulesandregulations are
often special foreachagency andare
notusually found inthestatutes but
inthose regulations; 2)amember of
thepublic must “exhaust his/her ad-
ministrative remedies” (take every
step, including appeals) with the
agency and itssystem before he/she
canchallenge theadministrative
ruling withalawsuit incourt. There
areexceptions (such asemergency
orobvious futility) toexhausting
one’s remedies, butthose arerare.
Administrative lawcanbeatechni-
caljungle, andmany lawyers make
lotsofmoney fromknowing how to
hack theirwaythrough itonbehalf
oftheir clients. (See: administra-
tivelawjudge, Administrative

fessional hearing officerwhoworks for
thegovernment topreside overhear-
ingsandappeals involving govern-
mental agencies. They aregenerally
experienced intheparticular subject
matter oftheagency involved orof
several agencies. Formerly called
“hearing officers,” they discovered
that there wasmore prestige and
higher payinbeing called “judge.”
Administrative Procedure Act: n.
thefederal actwhich established the
rulesandregulations forapplications,
claims, hearings andappeals involving
governmental agencies. There aresim-
ilaractsinmany states which spellout
therules fordealing with state gov-
ernment agencies. (See:administra-
tivehearing, administrative law)
administrator: n.theperson appoint-
edbythecourt tohandle theestate

withawillbutnonominated execu-
tor,ortheexecutor named inthewill

there isawillbutnoavailable ex-

“administrator with willannexed.”
Theprocedure isthat ifanestate
must beprobated (filed and ap-
proved byacourt) then someone
(usually arelative orclose friend) pe-
titions thecourt intheappropriate
county (usually where the late
lamented lastlived) forappointment
ofaparticular person asadministra-

admiralty: n.concerning activities
which occur atsea, including on
small boats andships innavigable
bays. Admiralty law(maritime law)
includes accidents and injuries at
sea,maritime contracts andcom-
merce, alleged violations ofrules of
theseaover shipping lames and
rights-of-way, andmutiny andother
crimes onshipboard. Jurisdiction
over allthese matters rests inthe
federal courts, which donotuseju-
riesinadmiralty cases. There are
other special rules inprocessing
maritime cases, which areoften
handled byadmiralty law special-
ists.Lawyers appearing inadmiral-
tycases arecalled “proctors.” (See:
maritime law)
admissible evidence: n.evidence
which thetrialjudge finds isuseful
inhelping thetrier offact(ajury if
there isajury, otherwise thejudge),
andwhich cannot beobjected to
onthebasis that itisirrelevant,
immaterial, orviolates therules
against hearsay andother objec-
tions. Sometimes theevidence
which aperson tries tointroduce
has little relevant value (usually
called probative value) indetermin-
ingsome fact, orprejudice from thejury’s shock atgory details may out-
weigh thatprobative value. Incrimi-
nalcases thecourts tend tobemore
restrictive onletting thejuryhear
such details forfearthey willresult in
“undue prejudice.” Thus, thejurymay
onlyhear asanitized version ofthe
facts inprosecutions involving vio-
lence. (See:evidence, objections)
admission: n.astatement made bya
party toalawsuit oracriminal defen-
dant, usually prior totrial, thatcertain
facts aretrue.Anadmission isnotto
beconfused withaconfession ofblame
orguilt, butadmits onlysome facts. In
civil cases, each party ispermitted to
submit awritten listofalleged facts
andrequest theother party toadmit or
denywhether each istrue orcorrect.
Failure torespond inwriting isan
admission ofthealleged facts and
maybeused intrial. (See:admission
against interest, confession)
admission against interest: n.an
admission ofthetruth ofafactby
any person, butespecially bythe
parties toalawsuit, when astate-
ment obviously would dothatperson
harm, beembarrassing, orbe
against his/her personal orbusiness
interests. Another party canquote in

admission tobail: n.anorder ofa
court inacriminal caseallowing an
accused defendant tobefreed pend-
ing trial ifhe/she posts bail (de-
posits either cash orabond) inan
amount setbythecourt. Theoreti-
cally theposting ofbail isintended
toguarantee theappearance ofthe
defendant incourtwhen required.
Inminor routine cases (e.g. petty
theft ordrunk driving) ajudge auto-
matically sets bailbased onarate
schedule which canbeobtained and
putupquickly. Otherwise bail isset
atthe first court appearance (ar-
raignment). Although theU.S.Con-
stitution guarantees theright to
bail, inextreme cases (murder, trea-
son,mayhem) thecourt isnotre-
quired toadmit aprisoner tobailof
anyamount duetothelikelihood of
thedefendent fleeing thearea, or
causing further harm. Bailbonds-
men areusually readily available
near larger courthouses and jails,
charge tenpercent oftheamount of
thecourt-required bond, andoften
demand collateral fortheamount
posted. Ifthedefendant fails to
show upincourt orflees (“jumps
bail”), thedefendant mayhave to
giveuphis/her deposit (bail).When
thecase isconcluded, thebail is“ex-
onerated” (released) andreturned to
thebailbondcompany ortowhoev-

adoption: n.thetaking ofachild into
one’s family, creating aparent tochild
relationship, andgiving himorherall
therights andprivileges ofone’sown
child, including theright toinherit as
ifthechildwere theadopter’s natural

depending onwhether thechildcomes
through anagency which handles
adoptions orcomes from astranger or
arelative, andontheageofthechild
andtheadoptive parent orparents.
Thehopeful adoptive parent must file
apetition, whichmaybehandled by
theadoption agency. Natural parents
must either givebinding written per-

ahearing before alocal court judge
(called “surrogate” insome states)
andanadoption order made. In
many states anewbirth certificate
canbeissued, with theadoptive
parents listed astheparents. If
there isanadoption ofanadult, the
adopting adult usually must besev-
eralyears older, based onthestate
law.Inrecent years, there hasbeen
much controversy overadoption by
single parents, including gaysand
lesbians, with thetendency toward
allowing such adoptions, provided
allother criteria beneficial tothe
child aremet. (See:adopt)
adseriatim (add sear-ee-ah-tim):
adj.Latin for“one after another”.
(See:seriatim )
adultery: n.consensual sexual rela-
tionswhen oneoftheparticipants
islegally married toanother. In
some states itisstillacrime and
and inmany states itisgrounds
fordivorce forthespouse ofthe
married adulterer. The criminal
charges arealmost never brought,
andinthose states inwhich there
isno-fault divorce (ordissolution),
adultery islegally notrelevant.
Until the1970s, incommunity
property states adultery was
grounds forgiving theperson
cheated uponmost ofthecouple’s
property, often resulting inlurid
andlong trials andgrist forscan-
dalnewspapers.advalorem:
adj.Latin for“based on
value,” which applies toproperty
taxes based onapercentage ofthe
county’s assessment oftheproperty’s
value. Theassessed value isthestan-
dard basis forlocal real property
taxes, although some place “caps”

sontooneofhisorherchildren or
heirs (apresumptive heirsinceanheir
isonly determined onthedate of

ample: JohnRichguy isgoing toleave
hisson$100,000 under hiswillora
percentage oftheestate onJohn’s
death. John gives theson$50,000 with
theintention that itwould bededuct-
edfrom theinheritance. Themain
problem isoneofproof thatthead-
vanced sumwasagainst theprojected
inheritance. Aperson making anad-
vancement should leave awritten
statement about theadvancement or
getasigned receipt. Such giftsmade
shortly before death aremore readily
treated asanadvancement than one
made several years earlier. (See:ben-

witness becomes openly antagonis-
tic,theattorney may request the
judge todeclare thewitness tobe

affirmative action laws.
affirmative defense: n.part ofan
answer toacharge orcomplaint in
which adefendant takes theoffense
andresponds totheallegations with

called “affirmative defenses.” These
defenses cancontain allegations,
take the initiative against state-
ments offactscontrary tothose stat-
edintheoriginal complaint against
them, andinclude various defenses
based onlegal principles. Many of
these defenses fallintothe“boiler-

iclanguage) category, butoneor
more ofthedefenses mayhelpthe

agency: n.therelationship ofaper-
son(called theagent) who actson
behalf ofanother person, company,
orgovernment, known astheprin-
cipal. “Agency” may arisewhen an
employer (principal) andemployee
(agent) asksomeone tomake ade-
livery orname someone asan
agent inacontract. Thebasic ruleisthattheprincipal becomes respon-
sible fortheactsoftheagent, andthe
agent’s actsarelikethose oftheprin-
cipal (Latin: respondeat superior).
Factual questions arise such as:was
theagent inthescope ofemployment
when he/she randown thelittle child,
gotdrunk andpunched someone, or
soldimpure wheat? There isalsothe
problem ofwhether theprincipal
acted insuchawayastomake others
believe someone was hisagent—this
isknown as“apparent” or“ostensi-
ble” authority. When someone who
isorisnotanemployee usescompa-
nybusiness cards, finance docu-

ityasanagent. (See:agent, author-
ity,respondeat superior, scope

actforanother (theagent’s principal)
through employment, bycontract or
apparent authority. Theimportance is
thattheagent canbind theprincipal

agency. Who isanagent andwhat is
his/her authority areoften difficult
and crucial factual issues. (See:

alimony: n.support paidbyoneex-
spouse totheother asordered bya
court inadivorce (dissolution) case.
Alimony isalsocalled “spousal sup-

states. Usually itispaidbythe
male tohisex,butinsome cases a
wealthy woman mayhave topay
herhusband, or,insame-sex rela-
tionships the“breadwinner” may
paytosupport his/her stay-at-home
former partner. Many counties and
states have adopted formulas for
alimony based ontheincome of
each party. Payment ofalimony is
usually limited intime based on
thenumber ofyears ofmarriage.
Lengthy marriages may result ina
lifetime ofpayments. Asubstantial
change incircumstance, such asill-
ness, retirement, orlossofincome,
canbegrounds forthecourt to
grant amodification ortermination
ofthepayment. Failure topayor-
dered alimony can result incon-
tempt ofcourt citations andeven
jailtime.The level ofalimony can
bedetermined bywritten agree-
mentandsubmitted tothecourt for
astipulated order. Income tax-wise,

alternative pleading: n.alegal fic-
tioninwhich aparty toalawsuit
oradefendant charged with a
crime canplead twoways which
areinconsistent with each other.
Examples: a)someone hurt inan
accident canplead that theother
party was negligent orran into
him intentionally, b)“not guilty”
and“notguilty byreason ofinsan-
ity” (inwhich there istheimplied
admission thatthedefendant com-
mitted theact).
ambiguity: n.when language has
more thanonemeaning. Iftheam-
biguity isobvious itiscalled
“patent,” and ifthere isahidden
ambiguity itiscalled “latent.” If
there isanambiguity, andtheorig-
inal writer cannot effectively ex-
plain it,then theambiguity willbe
decided inthelightmost favorable
totheother party.
amend: v.toalter orchange by
adding, subtracting, orsubstituting.
Onecanamend astatute, acontract
orawritten pleading filed inalaw-
suit.Thechange isusually called an
amendment. The legislature will
amend astatute, theparties toa
contract canamend it,andaparty
toalawsuit canamend hisorher
own pleading. Acontract canbeamended onlybytheparties partici-
pating inthecontract. Ifthecontract
iswritten, itcanbeamended only in
writing (although, curiously, anoral
contract canbeamended orally orin
writing). Apleading canbeamended
before itisserved ontheother party,
bystipulation oragreement incourt
between theparties (actually usually
between their attorneys), orupon
order ofthe court. (See:amended
complaint, amended pleading,
statute, stipulation)
amended complaint: n.what results
when theparty suing (plaintiff orpe-
titioner) changes thecomplaint he/she
has filed. Itmust beinwriting, and
canbedone before thecomplaint is
served onanydefendant, byagree-
ment between theparties (usually
their lawyers), orupon order ofthe
court. Complaints areamended tocor-
rect facts, addnewcauses ofaction
(bases forthelawsuit), substitute dis-
covered names forpersons sued as
“Does,” ortoproperly plead acause of
action (thelegal basis forsuing) after
thecourt hasfound thecomplaint in-
adequate. (See:amend, cause ofac-
tion,complaint, demurrer)
amended pleading: n.achanged writ-
tenpleading inalawsuit, including

Pleadings areamended forvarious
reasons, including correcting facts,
adding causes ofaction (legal bases for
asuit),adding affirmative defenses, or
responding toacourt’s finding thata
pleading isinadequate asamatter of
law.Amendments cannot bemade
willy-nilly, butonly prior tobeing
served, upon stipulation bytheparties

American BarAssociation: n.the
largest organization ofAmerican
lawyers, which hasnoofficial stand-

thelarger urban lawfirmsandthose
whoareinterested inbarassociation
politics. Nevertheless theA.B.A., its
leaders, and itslegal opinions are
highly respected, andthus itisan
important bellwether inlegal circles.
Itpublishes themonthly ABA Jour-

President Jimmy Carter’s granting
amnesty (under certain conditions)
tothosewho violated theSelective
Service Act inevading thedraft
during theVietnam War.Thebasis
foramnesty isgenerally because
thewar orother conditions that
made theactscriminal nolonger

Amnesty isnotapardon assome

amortization: n.aperiodic payment
plan topayadebt inwhich thein-
terest andaportion oftheprincipal
areincluded ineachpayment byan
established mathematical formula.
Mostcommonly itisusedonareal
property loanorfinancing ofanau-
tomobile orother purchase. Byfig-
uring theinterest onthedeclining
principal andthenumber ofyears of
theloan, themonthly payments are
averaged anddetermined. Since the
main portion oftheearlypayments
isinterest, theprincipal doesnotde-
cline rapidly until thelatter stages
oftheloanterm. Iftheamortization
leaves aprincipal balance atthe
close ofthetime forrepayment, this
finallumpsum iscalled a“balloon”
payment. (See:promissory note)
ancillary administration: n.ad-
ministration ofanestate’s assets in
another state.An“ancillary admin-
istrator” ischosen bytheexecutor
oradministrator ofanestate to
handle theproperty (primarily real
estate) ofthedeceased’s estate ina

There must beancillary administra-
tioninOhio toobtain Ohio court ap-

Technically ancillary means “aiding”
or“subordinate.” (See:administra-

(like“unclean hands,” “contributory
negligence” or“anticipatory breach”)
which areintended toderail the
claims inthecomplaint. Sometimes
theanswer isintheform ofa“gen-
eral denial,” denying everything.
Theanswer must beintyped form,
follow specific rules ofpleading es-
tablished bylawandthecourts, and
befiledwiththecourtandserved on
thedefendant within aspecific
statutory time (e.g.20or30days
after service ofthecomplaint). Ifthe

foreachdefendant filingananswer.
Inshort, ifserved acomplaint, one

(See:complaint, demurrer, gen-
eraldenial, verification)
antenuptial (prenuptial) agree-
ment: n.awritten contract between
twopeople whoareabout tomarry,
setting outtheterms ofpossession
ofassets, treatment offuture earn-
ings, control oftheproperty ofeach,
and potential division ifthemar-
riage islater dissolved. These are
fairlycommon ifeither orboth par-
tieshave substantial assets, chil-
drenfromaprevious marriage, po-
tential large inheritances, high in-
comes, orhave been “taken” bya
prior spouse.
anticipatory breach: n.when a
party toacontract repudiates (re-
neges on)his/her obligations under
thatcontract before fullyperformingthose obligations. Thiscanbebyword
(“Iwon’t deliver therestofthegoods”
or“Ican’tmake anymore payments”)
orbyaction (notshowing upwith
goods orstopping payments). The re-
sult isthattheother party does not
have toperform his/her obligations
andcannot beliable fornotdoing so.
This isoften adefense toalawsuit for
payment orperformance onacontract.
Onecannot repudiate hisobligations
anddemand thattheother person per-
form. (See:breach, contract)
antitrust laws: n.actsadopted byCon-
gress tooutlaw orrestrict business
practices considered tobemonopolis-
ticorwhich restrain interstate com-
merce. TheSherman Antitrust Actof
1890 declared illegal “every contract,
combination... orconspiracy inre-
straint oftrade orcommerce” between
states orforeign countries. TheClay-
tonAntitrust Actof1914,amended by
theRobinson-Patman Actof1936,
prohibits discrimination among cus-
tomers through pricing anddisallows
mergers, acquisitions ortakeovers of
onefirmbyanother iftheeffect will
“substantially lessen competition.” In-
terstate commerce includes commerce
within astatewhich affects theflowof
thatcommerce, thusmaking itpretty
broad. There arealsosome state laws
against restraint oftrade. TheAn-
titrust Division oftheU.S. Depart-
ment ofJustice enforces forthefeder-
algovernment, butprivate lawsuits to
halt antitrust activities havebecome
increasingly popular, particularly
since attorney’s feesareawarded to
thewinning party. This isalegal spe-
cialty which haskeptsome industries
relatively honest andmade some
lawyers wealthy. (See: price fixing,

apparent authority: n.theappear-
ance ofbeing theagent ofanother
(employer orprincipal) with the
power toactfortheprincipal. Since
under thelawofagency theemploy-
er(theprincipal) isliable fortheacts
ofhisemployee (agent), ifaperson
who isnotanagent appears toan
outsider (acustomer) tohave been
given authority bythe principal,
then theprincipal isstuck forthe
actsofanyone heallows toappear to
have authority. This“apparent au-
thority” canbegiven byproviding
JoeSlobovia (who hasnoauthority
tocontract) with materials, sta-
tionery, forms, atruck withacom-
pany logo, orletting himwork outof

appeal: 1)v.toaskahigher court to
reverse thedecision ofatrialcourt
after finaljudgment orother legal

ment isentered into therecord,
thelosing party (appellant) must
fileanotice ofappeal, request
transcripts orother records ofthetrial court (oragree with theother
party onan“agreed-upon state-
ment”), filebriefs with theappeals
court citing legal reasons forover-
turning theruling, andshowhow
those reasons (usually other appeal
decisions called “precedents”) relate
tothefacts inthecase.Nonew evi-
dence isadmitted onappeal, foritis
strictly alegal argument. Theother
party (Respondent orappellee) usu-
ally filesaresponsive brief counter-

Forstate cases there areSupreme
Courts (called Courts ofAppeal in
NewYorkandMaryland) which are

table tothefront ofthebench (the
large desk atwhich thejudge sits)
inorder tospeak tothejudge offthe
record and/or outofearshot ofthe
jury. Since thebench area isthesa-
cred territory ofthejudge theattor-
neymust askpermission as“may I
approach thebench,” orsimply,
“may Iapproach.” Ifthejudge con-
sents, then opposing counsel must
beallowed tocome forward and
participate intheconversation. The
purpose canrange from explaining
theorder ofwitnesses, atechnical
problem ortheneed totakearecess

“May Iapproach thewitness?” is
thetypical request, and itisal-
mostalways granted.
appurtenant: adj.pertaining to
something that attaches. Inreal
property law this describes any
right orrestriction which goeswith
that property, such asanease-
ment togain access across the
neighbor’s parcel, oracovenant
(agreement) against blocking the
neighbor’s view. Thus, there are
references toappurtenant ease-

Thearbitration maybeagreed toby

tance ofthe arbitrator’s decision.
(See:arbitrator)
arbitrator: n.onewhoconducts an
arbitration, andserves asajudge
whoconducts a“mini-trial,” some-
what lessformally than acourt
trial. Inmost cases thearbitrator is
anattorney, either alone oraspart
ofapanel. Most court jurisdictions
nowhave lists ofattorneys who
serve asarbitrators. Other arbitra-
torscome from arbitration services
which provide listsfromwhich the
parties canagree onanarbitrator
(many ofwhom areretired judges—
even “People’s Court” Judge Wapn-
erisonsuchapanel inLosAngeles
County). There isalsotheAmeri-
canArbitration Association which
usually hasapanel ofattorneys
chosen bytheassociation. Profes-
sional arbitration services arepaid
well tomove cases along. There are
alsoarbitrators whoareexperts on
everything from construction to
maritime damage. Insome con-
tracts there isaprovision forsuch
anexpert-type arbitrator named by
each sidewithathird chosen bythe
other two. (See: arbitration)
arguendo: prep. Latin meaning “for
thesake ofargument,” used by
lawyers inthecontext of“assuming
arguendo” thatthefactswere asthe
other party contends, butthelaw
prevents theother sidefrom pre-
vailing. Example: “assuming ar-
guendo” that thecourt finds our
client, thedefendant, wasnegligent,
theother party (plaintiff) was so
contributorily negligent hecannot
recover damages. Inshort, the
lawyer isnotadmitting anything,butwants tomake alegalargument
only. Theword appears most com-
monly inappeals briefs.
argumentative: adj.thecharacteriza-
tionofaquestion asked bytheoppos-
ingattorney which does notreally
seek information butchallenges the
truthfulness orcredibility ofthewit-
ness. Since suchaquestion isnotallow-
able, often itisthebasis ofanobjec-
tionbefore thequestion isanswered,
much like irrelevant, immaterial or
hearsay. The definition ofargumen-
tative issomewhat vague, and differ-
entjudges hear itdifferently. Asim-
pleexample would be“Doyoubelieve
youshould payyour mistress’ rent
before catching upwith delinquent
child support?” or“Doyouthink that
bloody glove justwalked overthere?”
arm’s length: adj.thedescription of
anagreement made bytwoparties
freely andindependently ofeach
other, andwithout some special rela-
tionship, such asbeing arelative,
having another dealontheside or
oneparty having complete control of
theother. Itbecomes important to
determine ifanagreement wasfreely
entered into toshow thattheprice,
requirements, andother conditions
were fairand real.Example: ifaman
sellsproperty tohissonthevalue set
may notbethetrue value since it
maynothavebeenan“arm’s length”
transaction. (See:contract)
arraign: v.tobring acriminal defen-
dant before thecourt, atwhich time
thecharges arepresented tohim/her,
theopportunity toenter aplea (orask
foracontinuance toplead) isgiven, a
determination ofwhether theparty
hasalawyer ismade (orwhether a

lawyer needs tobeappointed), ifnec-
essary setting theamount ofbail,and
future appearances arescheduled.
(See:appearance, arraignment)
arraignment: n.thehearing inwhich
aperson charged withacrime isar-
raigned inhisorherfirstappearance
before ajudge. This istheinitial ap-
pearance ofacriminal defendant (un-

arrears: n.money notpaidwhen due,
usually thesumofaseries ofunpaid
amounts, such asrent, installments
onanaccount orpromissory note, or
monthly child support. Sometimes
these arecalled “arrearages.”
arrest: v.1)totake orholdasus-
pected criminal with legal authori-
ty,asbyalawenforcement officer.
Anarrest may bemade legally
based onawarrant issued bya
court after receiving asworn state-
ment ofprobable cause tobelieve
there hasbeen acrime committed
bythis person, foranapparent
crime committed inthepresence of
thearresting officer, orupon proba-
blecause tobelieve acrime has
been committed bythat person.
Once thearrest hasbeenmade, the
officer must give the arrestee
his/her rights (“Miranda rights”) at
the first practical moment, and ei-
ther citetheperson toappear in
court orbring him/her intojail.A
person arrested must bebrought
before ajudge forarraignment ina
short time (e.g.within twobusiness
days), andhave his/her bail set.A
private “security guard” cannot ac-
tually arrest someone except bycit-articles ofimpeachment
izen’s arrest, butcanholdsomeone
briefly until alaw officer issum-
moned. A“citizen’s arrest” canbe
made byanyperson when acrime
hasbeencommitted inhis/her pres-
ence.However, such self-help arrests
canlead tolawsuits for“false arrest”
ifproved tobemistaken, unjustified
orinvolving unnecessary holding. 2)

assault: 1)v.thethreat orattempt to
strike another, whether successful or
not,provided thetarget isaware ofthe
danger. Theassaulter must berea-
sonably capable ofcarrying through
theattack. Insome states iftheas-
sault iswithadeadly weapon (such
assniping witharifle), theintended
victim doesnotneed toknow ofthe
peril. Other statelaws distinguish be-
tween different degrees (first orsec-
ond) ofassault depending onwhether
there isactual hitting, injury orjusta
threat. “Aggravated assault” isanat-
tackconnected with thecommission
ofanother crime, such asbeating a
clerk during arobbery oraparticu-
larly vicious attack. 2)n.theactof

Tomake this distinction theterm
“unincorporated association” isoften
used, although technically redundant.

fy)thejudgment. TheSupreme Court
hasruled thatanattachment maybe
made only after ahearing before a
judge inwhich both sides canargue
thedanger thattheparty being sued
(defendant) islikely toleave thearea
orotherwise avoid probable payment.
Atemporary attachment maybeal-

tion oftheparty wanting theattach-
ment thatthere isclear proof thatthe
defendant isgoing toflee.Thecourt
must alsorequire abond tocoverdam-

merely upon theplaintiff seeking the
attachment getting awrit ofattach-
ment, posting abond. (See: writ of

tempted forgery, attempted arson, and
ahostofother crimes. Theperson ac-

attest: v.1)toconfirm (usually in

attorney: n.1)anagent orsomeone
authorized toactforanother. 2)a
person whohasbeen qualified bya
state orfederal court toprovide legal
services, including appearing in
court. Each statehasabarexamina-

practice law.Theexaminations vary
indifficulty, butcannot betaken
until theapplicant isagraduate of
anaccredited law school (with athree-year minimum course ofstudy)
orinseven states has fulfilled exten-
siveother training. Passage ofthebar
examination qualifies theattorney for
that state onlyand forthefederal
courts located inthat state (andother
federal courts upon request). Some
states willaccept attorneys from other
states, butmany willnotgrant this
“reciprocity” and require atleast a
basic test forout-of-state attorneys.
Attorneys from other statesmayprac-
ticeinalimited way,butcannot ap-
pear(except onasingle casewithcourt
permission) instate courts (butinfed-
eral courts). Graduation from law
school doesnotmake oneanattorney.
There arealsopatent attorneys who

attorney’s advertising: n.thecom-
mercials which appear ontelevision or
crowd theyellow pages ofthe tele-
phone book. Until theSupreme Court
ruled (1977) thatany restriction on
lawyer advertising wasanabridge-
ment offree speech, advertising by
lawyers was illegal andcause fordis-
cipline ordisbarment. Oneproblem is
thatthesizeandcleverness oftheads
arenoindication ofthequality ofthe
49

attorney-client privilege
talent, experience, integrity, orlevel
ofpersonal attention bythe
lawyers. Ithasbeen saidthat “the
bigger thead,theworse theattor-
ney,” butthat isanexaggeration.
Advertising has ledtoa“chain
store” approach tolawrepresenta-
tionandtheuseofparalegals and
green attorneys atlowwages to
handle highvolume practices.
attorney-client privilege: n.there-
quirement thatanattorney maynot
reveal communications, conversa-
tionsand letters between himself/
herself and his/her client, under
thetheory thataperson should be
able tospeak freely andhonestly
with his/her attorney without fear
offuture revelation. Inatrial, de-
position, andwritten questions (in-
terrogatories), theattorney isre-
quired andtheclient isentitled to
refuse toanswer anyquestion or
produce anydocument which was
partoftheattorney-client contact.
Theproblem sometimes arises as
towhether theconversation wasin
anattorney-client relationship. If
aman tells hisneighbor whohap-
pens tobeanattorney thatheem-
bezzled funds, ishedoing sowhile
seeking legal advice orjust chat-
tingover thefence (which isthe
test)? Ifadocument wasprepared
aspart ofthelegal preparation for
aclient, itusually isa“work prod-
uct”and isalsoprivileged. Similar
privileges exist between pastor
andparishioner anddoctor andpa-
tient. (See:attorney’s work prod-
uct,privileged communication,

Attorney General: n.ineach state
andthefederal government thehighest ranking legal officer ofthe
government. The federal Attorney
General ischief oftheDepartment of
Justice appointed bythePresident
with confirmation required bythe
Senate, andamember oftheCabinet.
Heorshe isincharge offederal pros-
ecutions (including overseeing the
numerous regional U.S. Attorneys),
andnumerous cases andmatters in
which thefederal government hasa
legal interest, particularly when the
federal government isaparty orfed-
eralregulations areatissue. TheAt-
torney General alsohasoversight of
theFederal Bureau ofInvestigation
andother lawenforcement operations
oftheJustice Department. Although
elected, stateAttorneys General have
similar functions within their states,
although thesupervision oflocal pros-
ecutions isseldom exercised unless
there issome grossmismanagement.
Different legislatures have assigned
varying functions tothestate depart-
ments ofjustice, including consumer
protection, environmental law,super-
vision oftrusts andnon-profit corpo-
rations, andother issues inwhich the
stategovernment mayhave apartic-
ular interest inprotecting the citi-
zenry. (See: Solicitor General)
attorney-in-fact: n.someone specifi-
callynamed byanother through a
written “power ofattorney” toactfor
thatperson intheconduct oftheap-
pointer’s business. Ina“general
power ofattorney” theattorney-in-
factcanconduct allbusiness orsign

attorney ofrecord: n.theattorney
whohasappeared incourt and/or
signed pleadings orother forms on
behalf ofaclient. Thelawyer re-
mains theattorney ofrecord until
some other attorney orthe client
substitutes forhim/her, he/she isal-
lowed bythecourt towithdraw, or
after thecase isclosed. Sometimes
lawyers findthemselves stillonthe
record incases (such asdivorces)
which they believe have long since
been completed.
attorney’s fee: n.thepayment for
legal services. Itcantake several
forms: 1)hourly charge, 2)flatfee
fortheperformance ofaparticular
service (like$250 towrite awill), 3)
contingent fee(such asone-third of
thegross recovery, andnothing if
there isnorecovery), 4)statutory
fees(such aspercentages ofanes-
tate forrepresenting theestate), 5)
court-approved fees (such asinbankruptcy orguardianships), 6)
some mixture ofhourly andcontin-
gent feeorother combination. Itiswise
(and often mandatory) fortheattor-
neyandtheclient tohave asigned
contract foranyextensive legalwork,
particularly incontingent feecases.
Most attorneys keep records oftime
spent oncases tojustify fees(and
keep track ofwhen actions were
taken), evenwhen thework isnoton
anhourly basis.A“retainer” isadown
payment onfees, often required by
theattorney inorder tomake surehe
orshe isnotleftholding thebagfor
work performed, oratleast asagood
faith indication thattheclient isseri-
ousandcanafford theservices. On
theother hand, contingent fees re-
quire limits (often one-third) topro-
tecttheunwary client. Attorney fee
disputes canbedecided byarbitration,
often operated bythelocalbarassocia-
tion. Attorney’s feesarenotawarded
tothewinning party inalawsuit ex-
ceptwhere there isaprovision ina
contract forthefees orthere isa
statute which provides foranaward
offeesintheparticular type ofcase.
attorney’s work product: n.written
materials, charts, notes ofconversa-
tions and investigations, andother
materials directed toward preparation
ofacaseorother legal representation.
Their importance isthattheycannot
berequired tobeintroduced incourt or
otherwise revealed totheother side.
Sometimes there isaquestion asto
whether documents were prepared by
theattorney and/or theclient fortheir
useinthecasepreparation oraredoc-
uments which areindependent and
legitimate evidence. (See: attorney-

attractive nuisance doctrine
attractive nuisance doctrine: n.a
legal doctrine which makes aper-
sonnegligent forleaving apiece of
equipment orother condition on
property which would beboth at-
tractive anddangerous tocurious
children. These have included trac-
tors,unguarded swimming pools,
open pits,andabandoned refriger-
ators. Liability could beplaced on
thepeople owning orcontrolling
thepremises evenwhen thechild
wasatrespasser whosneaked on
theproperty. Basically thedoctrine
wasintended tomake people care-
ftdabout whatdangerous conditions
they leftuntended. Some jurisdic-
tions (including California) have
abolished theattractive nuisance
doctrine andreplaced itwith specific
conditions (e.g.open pitand refrig-
erators) andwould make property
owners liable onlybyapplying rules
offoreseeable danger which make
negligence harder toprove.
“atwill”employment: n.aprovision
found inmany employment con-
tracts which suggest theemployee
works atthewilloftheemployer,
andwhich theemployers insert in
order toavoid claims oftermination
inbreach ofcontract, breach ofthe
covenant ofgood faithandfairdeal-
ing,ordiscrimination. Inclusion of
suchaterm putstheburden onthe
discharged employee toshow that
heorshehadreasons tobelieve the

employer usesthe“atwill” provision
toclaim:Wecould firetheemployee

audit: n.anexamination bya
trained accountant ofthefinancialrecords ofabusiness orgovernmen-
talentity, including noting improper
orcareless practices, recommenda-
tions forimprovements, andabal-
ancing ofthebooks. Anaudit per-
formed byemployees iscalled “inter-
nalaudit,” andonedonebyaninde-
pendent (outside) accountant isan
“independent audit.” Even aninde-
pendent auditmaybelimited inthat

theauditor without anexamination
ofallsupporting documents. Audi-
tors willnote that theaudit was
based onsuch limited information
andwillrefuse tosigntheaudit asa

formation provided. (See:auditor)
auditor: n.anaccountant who con-
ducts anaudit toverify theaccuracy
ofthefinancial records andaccount-
ingpractices ofabusiness orgovern-
ment.Aproper audit willpoint out
deficiencies inaccounting andother
financial operations. Many counties
haveanappointed orelected auditor
tomake independent audits ofall
governmental agencies inthecounty
government. Theterm “auditor” is
often misused asmeaning any ac-
countant. (See: audit)
authorities: n.1)previous decisions
bycourts ofappeal which provide
legal guidance toacourt onques-
tions inacurrent lawsuit, which are
called “precedents.” Legal briefs
(written arguments) areoften called
“points and authorities.” Thus, a
lawyer “cites” thepreviously decided
cases as“authorities” forhis/her
legal positions. 2)acommon term for
lawenforcement, asin“I’mgoing to

order others toact.Often oneper-
songives another authority toact,
asanemployer toanemployee, a
principal toanagent, acorpora-
tiontoitsofficers, orgovernmental
empowerment toperform certain
functions. There aredifferent types
ofauthority, including “apparent
authority” when aprincipal gives
anagent various signs ofauthority
tomake others believe heorshe
hasauthority; “express authority”
or“limited authority,” which spells
out exactly what authority is
granted (usually awritten setof
instructions) “implied authority,”
which flows from theposition one

Bachelor ofLaws: n.thedegree in
lawfrom alawschool, abbreviated
toLLB,which means thattherecip-
ienthas successfully completed
three years oflawstudies inaddi-
tiontoatleast three undergraduate
years onanysubject. Since theearly
1960s most accredited lawschools
grant aJuris Doctor (JD)degree in-
stead oftheLLB.Lawschools which
made theswitch allowed theprior
holders oftheLLB toclaim theJD
retroactively. (See:Juris Doctor)

back-to-back lifesentences: n.
slang forconsecutive lifeterms im-
posed byajudgewhen there were
twocrimes committed bythede-
fendant, both ofwhich canresult
inpunishment ofalifeterm, such
astwomurders, oramurder anda

“life” sentence andwould wait an-
other 25years foraparole hearing.
(See:concurrent sentence)
baddebt: n.anuncollectible debt.
Theproblem istodetermine when
adebt isrealistically dead, which
means there must besome evi-dence ofuncollectibility oralengthy
passage oftime. Discharge inbank-
ruptcy, therunning ofthestatute of

debt “bad.” Forincome taxdeduction
purposes such adebt inbusiness is
deductible against ordinary income
(found infederal income taxForm

bad faith: 1)n.intentional dishonest
actbynotfulfilling legal orcontractu-
alobligations, misleading another, en-
tering intoanagreement without the
intention ormeans tofulfill it,orvio-

nizewhat iscalled “implied covenant
ofgood faithandfairdealing” which is
breached byactsofbadfaith, forwhich
alawsuit maybebrought (filed) forthe
breach (just asonemight sue for

bail: 1)n.themoney orbondputupto
secure therelease ofaperson whohas
beencharged with acrime. Forminor
crimes bail isusually setbyaschedule
54

bailiff
which willshow theamount tobe
paid before anycourt appearance
(arraignment). Formore serious
crimes theamount ofbail issetby
thejudge atthesuspect’s firstcourt
appearance. Thetheory isthat bail
guarantees theappearance ofthe
defendant incourtwhen required.
While theConstitution guarantees
theright toreasonable bail,acourt
maydeny bail incases charging
murder ortreason, orwhen there is
adanger thatthedefendant willflee
orcommit mayhem. Insome traffic
matters thedefendant may forfeit
the bailbynon-appearance since
thebail isequivalent tothefine. 2)
v.topostmoney orbond tosecure
anaccused defendant’s release. This
isgenerally called “bailing out”a
prisoner. (See: bailbond, bail
bondsman, ownrecognizance)
bailbond: n.abond provided byan
insurance company through abail
bondsman acting asagent forthe
company, tosecure therelease from
jailofanaccused defendant pending
trial.Usually there isacharge of10
percent oftheamount ofthebond
(e.g.$100 fora$1,000 bond) and
often thedefendant must putup
some collateral likeasecond deed of
trust ormortgage onone’s house.
Upon acquittal, conviction, orother
conclusion ofthecase, thebailbond
is“exonerated” andreturned tothe
insurance company. Iftheperson
whohasbeen bailed outdisappears
anddoes notappear incourt, the
bond funds willbeforfeited unless
thedefendant isfound and re-
turned. (See: bail, bailbondsman)
bailbondsman: n.aprofessional
agent foraninsurance companywho specializes inproviding bail
bonds forpeople charged withcrimes
andawaiting trial inorder tohave
them released. The offices ofabail
bondsman (orwoman) areusually
found close tothelocalcourthouse and
jail,his/her advertising isfound inthe
yellow pages, andsomemake “house
calls” tothejailorhand outcards in
court. Bailbondsmen usually charge
thesuspect afeeof10percent ofthe
amount ofthebond. Ifabailbonds-
manhasreason tobelieve aperson he

bailee: n.aperson, alsocalled acusto-
dian, withwhom some article isleft,
usually pursuant toacontract (called
a“contract ofbailment”), who isre-
sponsible forthesafereturn ofthear-
ticle totheowner when thecontract is
fulfilled. These caninclude banks
holding bonds, storage companies
where furniture orfilesaredeposited,
aparking garage, orakennel orhorse
ranch where ananimal isboarded.
Leaving goods inasealed rented box,
likeasafedeposit box, isnotabail-
ment, andtheholder isnotabailee
sincehecannot handle orcontrol the
goods. (See:bailment, bailor)
bailiff: n.1)acourt official, usually a
deputy sheriff, whokeeps order inthe
courtroom andhandles various er-
rands forthejudge and clerk. 2)in
some jurisdictions, aperson appointed
bythecourt tohandle theaffairs ofan
incompetent person ortobea“keeper”
ofgoods ormoney pending further
order ofthecourt. “Bailiff" has itsori-
gininOldFrench andMiddle English
forcustodian, andintheMiddle Ages
was asignificant position inthe
55

bailment
English court system. Theword
“bailiwick” originally meant theju-
risdictional territory ofabailiff.
bailment: n.1)theactofplacing
property inthecustody andcontrol
ofanother, usually byagreement
inwhich theholder (bailee) isre-
sponsible forthesafekeeping and
return oftheproperty. Examples:
bonds leftwith thebank, autos
parked inagarage, animals lodged
with akennel, orastorage facility
(aslongasthegoods canbemoved
andareunder thecontrol ofthe
custodian). While most are“bail-
ments forhire” inwhich thecusto-
dian (bailee) ispaid, there isalso
“constructive bailment” when the
circumstances create anobligation
upon thecustodian toprotect the
goods, and “gratuitous bailment”
inwhich there isnopayment, but
thebailee isstillresponsible, such
aswhen afinder ofalostdiamond
ring places itwith acustodian
pending finding theowner. 2)the
goods themselves which areheld
byabailee. Thus, the “bailor”
(owner) leaves the“bailment”
(goods) with the“bailee” (custodi-
an),andtheentire transaction isa
“bailment.” (See: bailee, bailor)
bailor: n.aperson wholeaves goods
inthecustody ofanother, usually
under a“contract ofbailment,” in
which thecustodian (“bailee”) is
responsible forthesafekeeping
andreturn oftheproperty. Some-
times thebailor isnottheowner
butaperson who isaservant of
theowner orafinder (say, ofjew-

bankruptcy
bank: n.1)anofficially chartered
institution empowered toreceive
deposits, make loans, andprovide
checking andsavings account ser-
vices, allataprofit. IntheUnited
States banks must beorganized
under strict requirements byeither
thefederal orastate government.
Banks receive funds forloans from
theFederal Reserve System pro-
vided theymeet safestandards of
operation andhave sufficient fi-
nancial reserves. Bank accounts
areinsured upto$100,000 perac-
count bytheFederal Deposit In-
surance Corporation. Most banks
areso-called “commercial” banks
withbroad powers. Intheeastand
midwest there aresome “savings”
banks which arebasically mutual
banks owned bythedepositors,
concentrate onsavings accounts,
andplace their funds insuch safe
investments asgovernment bonds.
Savings andloanassociations have
been allowed toperform some
banking services under so-called
deregulation in1981, butarenot
full-service commercial banks and
lack strict regulation. Mortgage
loanbrokers andthrift institutions
(often industrial loan companies)
arenotbanks anddonothave in-
surance andgovernmental control.
Severe losses tocustomers ofthese
institutions have occurred intimes
ofeconomic contraction ordue to
insider profiteering oroutright
fraud. Credit unions arenotbanks,
butarefairly safe since they are
operated bythemembers ofthein-
dustry, union orprofession ofthe
depositors and borrowers. 2)a
group ofjudges sitting together as
anappeals court, referred toas“in
bank” or“enbanc.”bankruptcy: n.afederal system of
statutes and courts which permits
persons andbusinesses which arein-
solvent (debtors) or(insome cases)
face potential insolvency, toplace
his/her/its financial affairs under the
control ofthebankruptcy court. The
procedure isthatwhen thedebtor’s
debts exceed his/her/its assets orabil-
itytopay,thedebtor can fileapeti-
tionwith thebankruptcy court for
voluntary bankruptcy orthedebtor’s
unpaid creditors can filean“involun-
tary” petition toforce thedebtor
intobankruptcy, although voluntary
bankruptcy isfarmorecommon. The
mostcommon petition isunder Chap-
ter7,inwhich atrustee isappointed
bythecourt, thecurrent assets are
counted upbythetrustee (withmany
ofthem exempt from bankruptcy),
whopays debts totheextent possible
with priority fortaxes, then secured
debts (mortgages orsomejudgments),
andfinally unsecured debts. Then the
court adjudicates (officially declares)
thedebtor abankrupt anddischarges
theunpayable debts, tothelossofthe
creditors. Exempt from sale topay
debts areaportion ofthevalue ofa
home (equal toahomestead), secured
notes thatcanbekept current, anau-
tomobile, tools ofthetrade, furniture,
andsome other items. Theconcept is
togivesomeone afresh start, but it
hasoften ledtocareless, profligate
business operations andcasual run-
ningupbillswith those giving credit
being badly hurt bybankruptcies.
Notdischargeable inbankruptcy are
alimony andchild support, taxes, and
fraudulent transactions.
Filing abankruptcy petition auto-
matically suspends allexisting legal
actions (even ontheeveoftrial or
judgment, oronthedayofforeclosure
57

bankruptcy court
onrealproperty), and isoften used
toforestall foreclosure orimposition
ofjudgment. After 45ormore days
acreditor with adebt secured by
realorpersonal property can peti-
tionthecourt tohave the“automat-
icstay” oflegal rights removed and
aforeclosure toproceed. Upon adju-
dication (officially declared) asa
bankrupt aparty cannot file for
bankruptcy again forseven years.
Chapter 11bankruptcy allows a
business toreorganize and refi-
nance tobeable toprevent final in-
solvency. Often there isnotrustee,
buta“debtor inpossession,” and
considerable time topresent aplan
ofreorganization. Sometimes this
works, butoften itisjustabottom-
lesspitofmore debtanddelay. The
finalplan often requires creditors to
takeonlyasmall percentage ofthe
debts due(what isowedthem) orto
takepayment overalongperiod of
time.Chapter 13issimilar toChap-
ter11,butisforindividuals towork
outpayment schedules, which is
more likely tobeworthwhile.
Bankruptcy lawhasbecome a
specialty due tocomplex regula-
tionaswellasadministration. Ini-
tialfeesmust bepaidupfront by
thepetitioner orthecreditors, but
much oftheassets maybeeaten
upbythecourt-approved fees of
thetrustees andattorneys (al-
though often theattorneys findno
assets available forpayment).
There aresome limited state
bankruptcy laws toaiddebtors,
butthey areseldom employed,
except tocreate creditors’ commit-
tees, which canbedeveloped
voluntarily. (See: bankruptcy
court, bankruptcy proceed-
ings, trustee inbankruptcy)bankruptcy court: n.thespecialized
federal court inwhich bankruptcy

eralbankruptcy courts ineach state,

alcounties. The office ofacourt clerk,
where petitions canbefiled, islocated
next toeach court. (See:bankrupt-
cy,bankruptcy proceedings)
bankruptcy proceedings: n.thebank-
ruptcy procedure is:a)filing apetition
(voluntary orinvoluntary) todeclare a
debtor person orbusiness bankrupt,
under Chapter 7,Chapter 11,orChap-
ter13,toallow reorganization orrefi-
nancing under aplan tomeet thedebts
oftheparty unable tomeet his/her/its
obligations. Thepetition issupposed to
include aschedule ofdebts, assets and
income potential, b)Ahearing called
“firstmeeting ofcreditors” with notice
toallknown creditors. This isoften
briefandusually results inthejudge
assigning thematter toaprofessional
trustee, c)Later thetrustee reports
andthere isadetermination ofwhat
debts aredischargeable, what assets
areexempt, andwhat payments are
possible, d)Ifthere areassets available

bifurcate: v.theorder orruling ofa
judge thatoneissue inacasecanbe
tried toaconclusion orajudgment
given ononephase ofthecasewith-
outtrying allaspects ofthematter.
Atypical example iswhen thejudge
willgrant adivorce judgment with-
outhearing evidence ormaking a
ruling onsuch issues asdivision of
marital property, child custody or
spousal support (alimony). Thus the
parties canbefree ofeach other
promptly while still fighting over
other issues attheir leisure. Ina
negligence casewhen thequestion
ofresponsibility (liability) isclearly
indoubt orrestsonsome legal tech-
nicality, thecourtmaybifurcate the
issues andhearevidence onthede-
fendant’s liability anddecide that
issue before goingahead withatrialontheamount ofdamages. Ifthe
court rules there isnoliability, then
theamount ofdamages ismeaning-
lessand further trial isnecessary.

bigamy: n.thecondition ofhaving two
wives ortwohusbands atthesame
time.Amarriage inwhich oneofthe
parties isalready legally married is
bigamous, void,andground foran-
nulment. Theonewhoknowingly en-
ters into abigamous marriage is
guilty ofthecrime ofbigamy, but it
isseldom prosecuted unless itispart
ofafraudulent scheme togetanoth-
er’sproperty orsome other felony.
Occasionally people commit bigamy
accidentally, usually inthebelief
thataprior marriage hadbeen dis-
solved. Themostfamous case inthe
United States wasthat ofAndrew
Jackson andhiswifeRachel Robards.
Ms.Robards’ husband hadapplied
foradivorce, but ithadnotbeen
granted (itrequired legislative ap-
proval) atthetime ofhersecond
marriage. Shecompleted thedivorce
andthen theJacksons remarried.
Jackson wasembarrassed for life
over hiscarelessness (hewas a
lawyer andajudge), which hadhurt
hiswife’s reputation. Having several
wives atthesame time iscalled
polygamy andbeing married tosev-
eralhusbands ispolyandry.
bilateral contract: n.anagreement in
which theparties exchange promises

BillofRights: n.thefirsttenamend-
ments tothefederal Constitution de-
manded byseveral states inreturn for
ratifying theConstitution, since the
failure toprotect these rights wasa
glaring omission intheConstitution
asadopted inconvention in1787.
Adopted andratified in1791, theBill
ofRights are:
First: Prohibits laws establishing a
religion (separation ofchurch and
state), andbanslawswhich would re-
strict freedom ofreligion, speech,
press(now interpreted ascovering all

binder
free state, theright ofthepeople to
keepandbearArms, shall notbe

giving theunfettered right ofindi-
viduals toownguns, but isactually
limited totheright of“the” people,
meaning thebody politic orthe
public asagroup, tobeararms as
militiamen.
Third: Noquartering ofsoldiers
inprivate homes without theown-
er’sconsent.
Fourth: Nounreasonable search

cotters, isanunfair labor practice
under federal andstate laws. (See:

own conduct), insurance brokers
(handling more thanonecompany
rather than being anagent forjust
asingle carrier), andstockbrokers,
who aretheupper-level ofstock

ofbrokerage houses. Brokers inthe
more technical fields (asabove) are

bucket shop: n.anunofficial and
usually illegal betting operation
inwhich theprices ofstocks and
commodities areposted and the
customers betontheriseand fall
ofprices without actually buying

capital
capital: 1)n.from Latin forcaput,
meaning “head,” thebasic assets of
abusiness (particularly corpora-
tions orpartnerships) orofanindi-
vidual, including actual funds,
equipment andproperty asdistin-
guished from stock intrade, inven-
tory, payroll, maintenance and ser-
vices. 2)adj.related tothebasic as-
setsoractivities ofabusiness orin-
dividual, such ascapital account,
capital assets, capital expenditure,
and capital gain orloss. 3)n.an
amount ofmoney aperson owns, as
in“howmuch capital doyouhave to
putintothisinvestment?” asdistin-
guished from theamount which
must befinanced. (See: capital ac-
count, capital assets, capital
gains orlosses, stock intrade)
capital account: n.therecord
which lists allbasic assets ofa
business, notincluding inventory
orthealleged value ofgood will.
capital assets: n.equipment, proper-
ty,andfunds owned byabusiness.
(See: capital, capital account)
capital expenditure: n.payment by
abusiness forbasic assets such as
property, fixtures, ormachinery, but
notforday-to-day operations such
aspayroll, inventory, maintenance
and advertising. Capital expendi-
tures supposedly increase thevalue
ofcompany assets andareusually
intended toimprove productivity.
capital gains: n.thedifference be-
tween thesales priceandtheorig-
inal cost (plus improvements) of
property. Capital gains taxes can
beaterrible financial shock toin-
dividuals whobought ahouse orbusiness many years ago forthe
going priceandnow find itishighly
valued, greatly duetoinflation. Ex-
ample: acouple buyahouse in1950
for$20,000 (then ahigh price) and
upon retirement want tosell itfor
$400,000. There isapotential oftax
ona$360,000 gain.There aresome

deferred (temporarily put off)tax if
investment property is“exchanged”
(profits areinvested inother proper-
ty)under strict rules, making life-
time gifts tochildren orcharity, or
buying another home. Another es-
cape isdeath, which gives theprop-
erty toheirs atthevalue ontheday
oftheowner’s death without capital
gains tax(“stepped upbasis”). Re-
duction ofcapital gains taxrates has
been resisted byamajority ofCon-
gress, partly because lowering the

capital offense: n.anycriminal charge
which ispunishable bythedeath
penalty, called “capital” since thede-
fendant could losehis/her head (Latin
forcaput). Crimes punishable by
death vary from state tostate and
country tocountry. In38American
states these offenses mayinclude first
degree murder (premeditated), mur-
derwith special circumstances (such
asintentional, multiple, involved with
another crime, with guns, ofapolice
officer, orarepeat offense), andrape
with additional bodily harm, andthe

federal crime oftreason. Acharge of
acapita] offense usually means no
bailwillbeallowed. (See: bail,cap-
italpunishment)
capital punishment: n.execution
(death) foracapital offense. The
U.S.Supreme Court hasvacillated
ontheapplication ofcapital punish-
ment, ruling intheFurman decision
(1972) that capital punishment was
aviolation oftheEighth Amend-
ment’s prohibition against “cruel
andunusual punishment” incertain
cases, andthen reinstated itin1976.
NewYork,which once ledthenation
inexecutions, abolished capital pun-
ishment butreinstated itin1995.
There isnocapital punishment in
Alaska, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas,
Massachusetts, Maine, Minnesota,
Michigan, North Dakota, Rhode Is-
land, Vermont, West Virginia and
theDistrict ofColumbia. There have
beennofederal executions inmore
than 30years. Texas, Florida,
Louisiana, Georgia, Virginia, andAl-
abama have held themost execu-
tions inrecent years. Means ofcapi-
talpunishment used intheUnited
States include lethal injection, elec-
trocution, gaschamber, hanging,
andfiring squad. Allcapital offenses
require automatic appeals, which
means that approximately 2,500
menandwomen arepresently on
“death row” awaiting their appeals
ordeath. (See:capital offense, Ap-
pendix oncapital punishment)
capitalization: n.1)theactof
counting anticipated earnings and
expenses ascapital assets (proper-
ty,equipment, fixtures) forac-
counting purposes. 2)theamount
ofanticipated netearnings whichhypothetically canbeused forcon-
version intocapital assets.
Forwhere nolaw is,there isno

care
jurisdiction has itsown rules asto
theexact format ofthecaption.
care: n.inlaw, tobeattentive, pru-
dentandvigilant. Essentially, care
(and careful) means thataperson
doeseverything he/she issupposed
todo(toprevent anaccident). Itis
theopposite ofnegligence (and
negligent), which makes the re-
sponsible person liable fordam-
ages topersons injured. Ifaperson
“exercises care,” acourt cannot
findhim/her responsible fordam-
ages from anaccident inwhich
he/she isinvolved. (See: careless)
careless: adj., adv. 1)negligent. 2)
theopposite ofcareful. Acareless
actcanresult inliability fordam-
ages toothers. (See: care, negli-
gence, negligent)
carnal knowledge: n.from Latin
camalis for“fleshly:” sexual inter-
course between amaleandfemale in
which there isatleastsome slight
penetration ofthewoman’s vagina
bytheman’s penis. Itislegally sig-
nificant inthat itisanecessary legal
characteristic orelement ofrape,
child molestation, orconsensual sex-
ualrelations with afemale below
theageofconsent (“statutoiy rape”).
Ageofconsent varies from 14to18,
depending upon the state. (See:
rape, statutory rape)
carrier: n.ingeneral, anyperson or
business which transports property
orpeople byanymeans ofcon-
veyance (truck, auto, taxi, bus, air-
plane, railroad, ship), almost always
foracharge. The carrier isthe
transportation system andnotthe
owner oroperator ofthesystem.There aretwotypes ofcarriers: com-
mon carrier (intheregular business
orapublic utility oftransportation)
andaprivate carrier (aparty notin
thebusiness, which agrees tomake a
delivery orcarry apassenger inaspe-
cific instance). Common carriers are
regulated bystates andbytheInter-
stateCommerce Commission ifthey
cross state lines. (See:common car-
rier,private carrier)
carryback: n.intaxation accounting,
using acurrent taxyear’s deduc-
tions, business losses orcredits tore-
figure andamend apreviously filed
taxreturn toreduce thetaxliability.
(See:carryover)
carrying forhire: n.theactoftrans-
porting goods orindividuals forafee.
Itisimportant todetermine ifthecar-
rierhasliability forsafedelivery oris
subject toregulation. (See: carrier,
common carrier, private carrier).
carrying onbusiness: v.pursuing a
particular occupation onacontinuous
andsubstantial basis. There need not
beaphysical orvisible business “enti-
ty”assuch.
carryover: n.intaxation accounting,
using ataxyear’s deductions, busi-
ness losses orcredits toapply tothe
following year’s taxreturn toreduce
thetaxliability. (See:carryback)
cartel: n.1)anarrangement among
supposedly independent corporations
ornational monopolies inthesame in-
dustrial orresource development field
organized tocontrol distribution, set
prices, reduce competition, andsome-
times share technical expertise. Often
theparticipants aremultinational
76

cashier’s check
corporations which operate across
numerous borders andhave little
ornoloyalty toanyhome country,
andgreat loyalty toprofits. The
most prominent cartel isOPEC
(Organization ofPetroleum Ex-
porting Countries), which repre-
sents allofthe oilproducing coun-
tries intheMiddle East, North
Africa andVenezuela. Many cartels
operate behind aveil ofsecrecy,
particularly since under American
antitrust laws (theSherman and
Clayton Acts) they areillegal. 2)a
criminal syndicate liketheinter-
national drug cartel headquartered
inColombia. (See:antitrust laws,)
case: n.short foracause ofaction,
lawsuit, ortheright tosue(asin
“does hehave acase against
Jones?”). Itisalsoshorthand forthe
reported decisions (appeals, certain
decisions offederal courts andspe-
cialcourts such asthetaxcourt)
which canbecited asprecedents.
Thus, “inthecase ofMalarkey v.
Hogwash Printing Company, the
court stated therule as....”
caselaw: n.reported decisions ofap-
peals courts andother courts which
make new interpretations ofthe
lawand, therefore, canbecited as
precedents. These interpretations
aredistinguished from “statutory
law,” which isthestatutes and
codes (laws) enacted bylegislative
bodies; “regulatory law,” which is
regulations required byagencies
based onstatutes; and insome
states, thecommon law,which is
thegenerally accepted lawcarried
down fromEngland. Therulings in
trials andhearings which arenot
appealed andnotreported arenotcaselawand, therefore, notprece-
dentornewinterpretations. Law stu-
dents principally study caselaw to
understand theapplication oflawto
facts and learn the courts’ subse-
quent interpretations ofstatutes.
(See:casesystem, precedent)
case offirstimpression: n.acase in
which aquestion ofinterpretation of
law ispresented which hasnever
arisen before inanyreported case.
Sometimes, itisonly offirstimpres-
sionintheparticular state orjurisdic-
tion, sodecisions from other states or
thefederal courtsmaybeexamined as
aguideline.
casesystem: n.themethod ofstudying
lawgenerally used inAmerican law
schools, inwhich thestudents read,
outline (brief), discuss andhear lec-
tures about thecases. Each case pre-
sented stands foraparticular rule of
lawinthesubject matter covered and
iscontained in“casebooks” onparticu-
lartopics (contracts, torts, criminal
law, constitutional law, agency, etc.).
Thesystem isuseful since itrelates
thelawtoretdandfactual situations
which assist students inmemoriza-
tionandencourages deductive reason-
ing.Thecasesystem isreinforced by
textbooks andoutlines onthesubject
matter, which were formerly theprin-
cipal sources oflearning. Themethod
wasintroduced first atHarvard in
1869 byprofessor Christopher C.
Langdell andsoonbecame standard.
cashier’s check: n.acheck issued bya
bank onitsown account forthe
amount paid tothebankbythepur-
chaser withanamed payee, andstat-
ingthename oftheparty purchasing
thecheck (theremitter). Thecheck is
77

casual
received ascash since itisguaran-
teedbythebankanddoesnotde-
pendontheaccount ofaprivate in-
dividual orbusiness. Cashiers’
checks arecommonly usedwhen
payment must becredited immedi-
ately upon receipt forbusiness,
realestate transfers, taxpayments
andthelike.
casual: adj.defining something that
happens bychance, without being
foreseen, orinformally. This in-
cludes “casual” labor oremploy-
ment, which issomeone hired todo
atask justbecause he/she was
available atthemoment. “Casual
laborer” carries theimplication
thatthelaborer doesnotbelong to
aunion andthattheemployer and
thelaborer willnotpayappropri-
atetaxes onthewages paid.
casualty: n.1)anaccident which
could nothave been foreseen or
guarded against, such asaship-
wreck caused bystorm orfire
caused bylightning. 2)theloss, as
oflife,from suchanunavoidable
accident. Thecourts remain incon-
sistent ontheexact definition.
(See:casualty loss)
casualty loss: n.intaxation, loss
duetodamage which qualifies for
acasualty losstaxdeduction. It
must becaused byasudden, unex-
pected orunusual occurrence such
asastorm, flood, fire,shipwreck,
earthquake oractofGod, but
would notinclude gradual damage
fromwater seepage orerosion.
cause: from Latin causa: 1)v.to
make something happen. 2)n.the
reason something happens. Acauseimplies what iscalled a“causal con-
nection” asdistinguished fromevents
whichmayoccur butdonothaveany
effect onlater events. Example:
While driving hisconvertible, Johnny
Youngblood begins tostare atpretty
Sally Golightly, who isstanding on
thesidewalk. While sodistracted he
veers intoacarparked atthecurb.
Johnny’s inattention (negligence) is
thecause oftheaccident, andneither
Sally norherbeauty isthecause. 3)
n.short forcause ofaction. (See:
cause ofaction, proximate cause)
Thefineforpeering intoyour
neighbor’s house without per-
mission isonecow.—Irish Laws, collected by
MaryDowling Daley
cause ofaction: n.thebasis ofalaw-
suitfounded onlegalgrounds and al-
leged facts which, ifproved, would
constitute allthe“elements” required
bystatute. Examples: tohave acause
ofaction forbreach ofcontract there
musthavebeenanoffer ofacceptance;
foratort (civil wrong) there must
have been negligence orintentional
wrongdoing andfailure toperform; for
libeltheremusthavebeenanuntruth
published which isparticularly harm-
fill;andinallcases theremust bea
connection between theactsofthede-
fendant anddamages. Inmany law-
suits there areseveral causes ofaction
stated separately, such asfraud,
breach ofcontract, anddebt, ornegli-
gence andintentional destruction of
property. (See:element, lawsuit)
caveat: n.(kah-vee-ott) from Latin
caveat for“lethim beware.” 1)a
warning orcaution. 2)apopular term
78

certified check
usedbylawyers topoint outthat
theremaybeahidden problem or
defect. Ineffect, “Ijustwant to
warnyouthat...”
caveat emptor: (kah-vee-ott emptor)
Latin for“letthebuyer beware.” The
basicpremise thatthebuyer buys at
his/her own riskand therefore
should examine andtestaproduct
himself/herself forobvious defects
and imperfections. Caveat emptor
stillapplies even ifthepurchase is
“as is”orwhen adefect isobvious
upon reasonable inspection before
purchase. Since implied warranties
(assumed quality ofgoods) andcon-
sumer protections havecomeupon
thelegal landscape, theseller isheld
toahigher standard ofdisclosure
than “buyer beware” andhas re-
sponsibility fordefects which could
notbenoted bycasual inspection
(particularly sincemodem devices
cannot betested except byuseand
many products arepre-packaged).
(See:consumer protection laws)
ceaseanddesist order: n.anorder
ofacourt orgovernment agency to
aperson, business ororganization
tostop doing something upon a
strong showing thattheactivity is
harmful and/or contrary tolaw.
Theordermay bepermanent or
hold until afinal judicial determi-
nation oflegality occurs. Inmany
instances theactivity isbelieved to
cause irreparable damage such as
receipt offunds illegally, felling of
timber contrary toregulation, sell-
ingofshares ofstock without a
proper permit, oroildrilling which
would damage theecology.
certificate ofdeposit (CD): n.adocument issued byabank inreturn
foradeposit ofmoney which pays a
fixed interest rate foraspecified peri-
od(from amonth toseveral years). In-
terest rates onCD’s areusually high-
erthan savings accounts because
banking institutions require acom-
mitment toleavemoney intheCDfor
afixed period oftime. Often there isa
financial penalty (fee) forcashing ina
CDbefore thepledged timeruns out.
certificate ofincorporation: n.doc-
ument which some states issue to
prove acorporation’s existence upon
thefiling ofarticles ofincorporation.
Inmost states thearticles aresuffi-
cient proof.
certificate oftitle: n.generally, the
titledocument foramotor vehicle is-
suedbythestate inwhich itisregis-
tered, describing thevehicle bytype
andengine number, aswell asthe
name andaddress oftheregistered
owner andthelienholder (financial
institution thatloaned money tobuy
thecar). Since insome states these
documents areusually pink, thecer-
tificate oftitle issometimes called a
“pink slip.” (See:pink slip)
certified check: n.acheck issued by
abank which certifies that the
maker ofthecheck hasenough
money inhis/her account tocover the
amount tobepaid. Thebank sets
aside thefunds sothatthecheck will
remain goodeven ifother checks are
written ontheparticular account.
Like acashier’s check, acertified
check guarantees that itisimmedi-
ately good since itisguaranteed by
thebankandtherecipient does not
have towait until it“clears.” (See:
cashier’s check)

challenge: n.theright ofeach attorney
inajuiy trial torequest thatajuror
beexcused. Theremaybea“challenge
forcause” onthebasis thejurorhad
admitted prejudice orshows some ob-
vious conflict ofinterest (e.g.thejuror
used towork forthedefendant orwas
oncecharged with thesame type of
crime) which thejudge must resolve.
Ifthejuror isexcused (removed) “for
cause,” then thechallenge does not
count against thelimited number of
challenges allowed each side.More
common isthe“peremptory chal-
lenge,” which isarequest thatajuror
beexcused without stating areason.
Anattorney might say:“Juror number
eightmaybeexcused.” Only sixor
eight peremptory challenges arenor-
mally allowed each side. Systematic
peremptoiy challenges ofallblacks or
allwomen maybeexamples andproof
thatadefendant hasbeen deprived of
ajuryofhis/her peersandresult inan
appeal based onlack ofdueprocess.

similar case(having been convicted
ofdrunk driving, being abattered
wife, etc.),anyobvious prejudice, or
inability toserve (such asbeing
mentally disturbed). Thejudge de-
termines iftheperson shall bedis-
missed. Challenges and dismissal
forcause differ from peremptory
challenges, which each sidemayuse
todismiss potential jurors without
stating anyreason. (See: juror,
jury, panel, peremptory chal-

Chief Justice: n.thepresiding judge
ofanyStateSupreme Court andthe
U.S.Supreme Court. TheChief Jus-

thenmust beconfirmed bytheU.S.
Senate. TheChief Justice setsthe
tone forthecourt, assigns thewrit-
ingofmajority opinions tofellowjustices ortohimself/herself, and
oversees themanagement ofthecourt
and its staff. Since U.S.Supreme
Court justices serve for lifeoruntil
voluntary retirement, theycanhave
long-term influence. There havebeen
only 16U.S.Supreme Court Chief
Justices inover200years. Allbuttwo
were appointed from outside the

most allstates. (See:minor)
child custody: n.acourt’s determina-
tionofwhich parent, relative orother
adult should have physical and/or
legal control and responsibility fora
minor (child) under 18.Child custody
canbedecided byalocal court inadi-

legal. Joint legal custody isbecom-
ingincreasingly common. The
basic consideration oncustody
matters issupposed tobethebest
interests ofthechild orchildren.
Inmost cases thenon-custodial
parent isgiven visitation rights,
which may include weekends,
parts ofvacations andother occa-
sions.Thecourt canalways change
custody ifcircumstances warrant.
(See: child support, custody,
dissolution ofmarriage, di-
vorce, joint custody)
child support: n.court-ordered
funds tobepaidbyoneparent to
thecustodial parent ofaminor
child after divorce (dissolution) or
separation. Usually the dollar
amounts arebased ontheincome of
both parents, thenumber ofchil-
dren, theexpenses ofthecustodial
parent, andanyspecial needs ofthe
child. Inmany states orlocales the
amount isdetermined byachart
which factors inallthese figures. It
may alsoinclude health plan cover-
age,school tuition orother expens-
es,andmaybereduced during peri-
odsofextended visitation such as
summer vacations. Child support
generally continues until thechild
reaches 18years, graduates from
high school, isemancipated (no
longer liveswith either parent), or,
insome cases, foranextended peri-
odsuch ascollege attendance. The
amount andcontinuation ofsup-
portmaybechanged bythecourt
upon application ofeither party de-
pending onaproved change ofcir-
cumstance oftheparents orchild.
Child support should notbecon-
fused with alimony (spousal sup-
port) which isfortheex-spouse’ssupport. Child support isnot
deductible from gross income for
taxpurposes (butmayallow adepen-
dentexemption) nor isittaxed asin-
come, unlike alimony, which isde-
ductible bythepayer andtaxed asthe
adult recipient’s income. (See:alimo-
ny,child custody, dissolution of
marriage, divorce, spousal sup-
port,change ofcircumstances)
churning: n.theunethical andusual-
lyillegal practice ofexcessive buying

circuit courts: n.amovable court in
which thejudge holds court sessions
atseveral different locations forpre-
specified periods oftime. Ineffect, the
judge “rides thecircuit” fromtown to
town andtakes the“court” with
him/her. Formerly, theFederal Dis-
trictCourts ofAppeal were called the
Circuit Courts ofAppeal.
circumstantial evidence: n.evidence
inatrialwhich isnotdirectly froman
eyewitness orparticipant andrequires
some reasoning toprove afact.There
isapublic perception thatsuch evi-
dence isweak (“alltheyhave iscir-
cumstantial evidence”), buttheproba-
bleconclusion from thecircumstances
maybesostrong thatthere canbelit-
tledoubt astoavital fact(“beyond a
reasonable doubt” inacriminal case,
and“apreponderance oftheevidence”
inacivil case). Particularly incriminal
cases, “eyewitness” (“IsawFrankie
84

civil
shoot Johnny”) typeevidence isoften
lacking andmay beunreliable, so
circumstantial evidence becomes es-
sential. Prior threats tothevictim,
fingerprints found atthescene ofthe
crime, ownership ofthemurder
weapon, andtheaccused being seen
intheneighborhood, certainly point
tothesuspect asbeing thekiller, but
each bitofevidence iscircumstan-
tial. (See:evidence)

ingloyalty toanother country, includ-
ingserving inarmed forces potentially
unfriendly totheUnited States, orvot-

overlook thisduality ofnationalities.

anteed under theConstitution
(and the interpretations and
statutes intended toimplement
theenforcement ofthose rights)
such asvoting, equitable taxation,
freedom ofspeech, press, religion
andassembly. Generally these are

have required constant diligence
and struggle toensure and ex-
pand, asintheCivil Rights move-
mentbetween 1950and1980. Vio-
lation ofone’s civilrightsmaybea

statutes. Civil rights include civil
liberties. Civil liberties emphasize
protection frominfringement upon
basic freedoms, while statutory

“who aresimilarly situated.” Exam-
plesmight include: allwomen who
have suffered from defective contra-
ceptive devices orbreast implants,

cleanhands doctrine: n.aruleoflaw
thataperson coming tocourt witha

must befreefrom unfair conduct
(have “clean hands” ornothavedone
anything wrong) inregard tothesub-
jectmatter ofhis/her claim. His/her
activities notinvolved inthelegal ac-
tioncanbeabominable because they
areconsidered irrelevant. Asanaffir-
mative defense (positive response) a
defendant might claim theplaintiff
(party suing him/her) hasa“lack of
clean hands” or“violates theclean
hands doctrine” because theplaintiff
hasmisled thedefendant orhasdone
something wrong regarding themat-
terunder consideration. Example: A
former partner suesonaclaim that
hewasowedmoney onaconsulting
contract with thepartnership when

theplaintiff (party suing) hastried to
getcustomers from thepartnership
byspreading untrue stories about the

counsel forthedefendant, andthen
theplaintiffs attorney canrespond
tothedefense argument. Unlike
the“opening statement,” which is
limited towhat isgoing tobe
proved, the “closing argument”

cohabitation: n.living together in
thesame residence, generally ei-
therashusband andwifeorforan
extended period oftime asifthe
parties were married. Cohabitation
implies thattheparties arehaving
sexual intercourse while living to-

apply toacasual sexual encounter.
Legal disputes have arisen asto
whether cohabitation would refer
tosame sexpartners, which isim-
portant tothose involved since “co-
habitation” isthebasis ofcertain
rights andprivileges under various
laws, regulations and contracts.
Thefindings ofthecourts varyon
thisquestion, butthetrend istoin-

commercial frustration: n.anun-
foreseen uncontrollable event which
occurs after awritten ororalcon-
tract isentered intobetween par-
ties,andmakes itimpossible for
oneoftheparties tofulfill his/her
duties under thecontract. This cir-
cumstance allows thefrustrated
party torescind thecontract with-
outpenalty. Such frustration (called
frustration ofpurpose) could in-
clude thedestruction byfireofthe
goods tobepurchased, thedenial of
apermit toconstruct abuilding
byapotential buyer, ordenial ofan
application forazoning variance
toallow expansion byacontractor.
(See: contract, frustration of
purpose, impossibility)
commercial law: n.allthelaw
which applies totherights, rela-

spouse maythus riskturning sepa-
rateproperty intocommunity prop-
erty (transmutation), andabusi-
nesspartner mayhave toaccount
tothe other. However, trustees,
guardians orlawyers holding client
funds must becareful nottocom-mingle those funds with their own,
since commingling isgenerally pro-
hibited asaconflict ofinterest. Useof
commingled funds foraninvestment,
eventhough itmight benefit boththe
trustee andthebeneficiary, isstill
improper. Inadvertent commingling
ortemporary commingling (say,
upon receipt ofasettlement check in
which both theclient andattorney
have aninterest) requires prompt
separation offunds andaccounting
totheclient orbeneficiary. Toavoid
commingling, trustees, lawyers,
guardians andthose responsible for
another’s funds setuptrust accounts
forfunds ofanother.
commission: n.1)afeepaidbased on

common law: n.thetraditional un-written lawofEngland, based oncus-

opoverathousand years before the
founding oftheUnited States. The
bestofthepre-Saxon compendiums of

tenbyawoman, Queen Martia, wife
ofaking ofasmall English kingdom.
Together withabookonthe“law of
themonarchy” byaDuke ofCornwall,
Queen Martia’s workwastranslated
intotheemerging English language
byKing Alfred (849-899 A.D.).When
William theConqueror invaded Eng-
land in1066, hecombined thebestof
thisAnglo-Saxon lawwithNorman
law,which resulted intheEnglish
common law,much ofwhich wasby
custom andprecedent rather than
bywritten code.Bythe14thcentury
legal decisions andcommentaries on
thecommon lawbegan providing
precedents forthecourts andlawyers
tofollow. Itdidnotinclude theso-
called lawofequity (chancery), which
came from theroyalpower toorder or
prohibit specific acts.Thecommon
lawbecame thebasic lawofmost
states due totheCommentaries on
theLaws ofEngland, completed by
SirWilliam Blackstone in1769,
which became every American
lawyer’s bible. Today almost allcom-
mon lawhasbeen enacted into
statutes withmodem variations by
allthestates except Louisiana, which
isstillinfluenced bytheNapoleonic
Code. Insome states theprinciples of
Common Law aresobasic they are
applied without reference tostatute.

common stock: n.stock inacorpora-
tion inwhich dividends (payouts)
arecalculated upon apercentage of
netprofits, with distribution deter-
mined bytheboard ofdirectors.Usually holders ofcommon stock
have voting rights. These aredistin-
guished from preferred stock inwhich
theprofits areapredetermined per-
centage andarepaid before thecom-
mon shareholders whogamble on
higher profits, and collectively have
voting control ofthecorporation.
(See: corporation, preferred
stock, share, stock )
community property: n.property
and profits received byahusband
andwifeduring themarriage, with
theexception ofinheritances, specific
gifts tooneofthespouses, andprop-
ertyand profits clearly traceable to
property owned before marriage, allof
which isseparate property. Communi-
typroperty isaconcept which began
inSpain toprotect richwomen from
losing everything toprofligate hus-
bands, and isonly officially recognized
insome states which were onceunder
orinfluenced bySpanish orMexican
control, including California, Arizona,
New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, Idaho,
Washington andLouisiana. Commu-
nity property recognizes theequal
contribution ofboth parties tothe
marriage even though one orthe
othermayearnmoreincome through
employment. Byagreement oraction
themarried couple canturn (trans-
mute) separate property intocommu-
nity property, including bycommin-
glingcommunity andseparate funds
inoneaccount. Community property
isrecognized based onfactoragree-
ment oftheparties, rather than hold-
ingoftitle.Thestate courts havewa-
vered onwhat constitutes proof of
community property, including the
issue ofwhether jointtenancy isevi-
dence ofcommunity property ornot.
Upon divorce community property is

commutation: n.theactofreducing
acriminal sentence resulting froma
criminal conviction bytheexecutive
clemency oftheGovernor ofthe
state, orPresident oftheUnited
States inthecaseoffederal crimes.
This isnotthesame asapardon,
which wipes outtheconviction or
theactual orpotential charge (as
when President Gerald R.Ford par-
doned ex-President Richard M.
Nixon evenwithout charges having
been officially made—arare in-

thattheconviction waswrong, that
there hasbeencomplete rehabilita-
tionoftheparty, orthathe/she has
lived anexemplary lifeformany
years anddeserves tohave his/her
name cleared inoldage.Commuta-
tionimplies thepenalty wasexces-

company: n.anyformal businessentity for profit, which may bea
corporation, apartnership, association
orindividual proprietorship. Often
people think theterm “company”
means thebusiness isincorporated,
butthat isnottrue. Infact,acorpora-
tionusually must usesometerm inits
name such as“corporation,” “incorpo-
rated,” “corp.” or“inc.” toshow itisa

comparative negligence: n.aruleof
lawapplied inaccident cases todeter-
mine responsibility anddamages
based onthenegligence ofevery party
directly involved intheaccident. Fora
simple example, Eddie Leadfoot, the
driver ofoneautomobile, isspeeding
andRudy Airhead, thedriver ofanon-
coming car,has failed tosignal and
starts toturn left,incorrectly judging
Leadfoot’s speed.Acrash ensues in
which Airhead ishurt. Airhead’s dam-
agerecovery willbereduced bythe
percentage hisfailure tojudge Lead-
foot’s speed contributed toorcaused
theaccident. Most cases arenotas
simple, andtheformulas tofigure out,
attribute andcompare negligence
oftenmake assessment ofdamages
problematic, difficult, andpossibly to-
tally subjective. Not allstates use
comparative negligence (California is
afairly recent convert), andsome
states stillusecontributory negli-
gence which denies recovery toany
party whose negligence hasadded to
thecause oftheaccident inanyway.
Contributory negligence isoften so
unfair that juries tend toignore it.
(See: contributory negligence,
damages, negligence)
compensation: n.1)payment forwork
performed, bysalary, wages, commis-
sionorotherwise. Itcaninclude giv-
96

inggoods rather thanmoney. 2)the
amount received to“make one
whole” (oratleast better) afteran
injury orloss,particularly thatpaid
byaninsurance company either of
theparty causing thedamage orby
one’sown insurer.
compensatory damages: n.dam-
agesrecovered inpayment forac-
tualinjury oreconomic loss,which
doesnotinclude punitive damages
(asadded damages due tomali-
cious orgrossly negligent action).
(See:damages, general dam-
ages, punitive damages, spe-

competent: adj. 1)ingeneral, able to
actinthecircumstances, including
theability toperform ajoboroccu-
pation, ortoreason ormake deci-
sions. 2)inwills, trusts and con-
tracts, sufficiently mentally able to
understand andexecute adocu-
ment. Tobecompetent tomake a

petency), andwhoarerelatives who

alobjects ofhis/her bounty”) suchas
children andspouse (although for-
getting achild inawill isnotauto-
matic proof oflack ofcompetency,
since itmaybeintentional orthe
childhasbeenlonggone). 3)incrim-
inal law, sufficiently mentally able

means “relevant” and/or “material.”
Lawyers oftenmake theobjection to

complainant: n.aperson orentity
whobegins alawsuit byfiling acom-
plaint and isusually called
the plaintiff, orinsome cases the
petitioner. (See: complaint, peti-
tioner, plaintiff)
complaint: n.thefirstdocument filed
with thecourt (actually with the
County Clerk orClerk oftheCourt) by
aperson orentity claiming legal
rights against another. Theparty fil-
ingthecomplaint isusually called the
plaintiff andtheparty against whom
thecomplaint isfiled iscalled thede-
fendant ordefendants. Complaints
arepleadings andmust bedrafted
carefully (usually byanattorney) to
properly state thefactual aswellas
legal basis fortheclaim, although
some states haveapproved complaint
forms which canbefilled inbyanin-
dividual. Acomplaint alsomust follow
statutory requirements astoform.
Forexample, acomplaint must be
typed onaspecific type ofpaper oron
forms approved bythecourts, name
both thepartymaking theclaim and
alldefendants, andshould statewhat
damages orperformance isdemanded
(the prayer). When thecomplaint is
filed, thecourt clerk willissue asum-
mons, which gives thename and file
number ofthelawsuit andtheaddress
oftheattorney filing thecomplaint,
97

compos mentis
and instructs thedefendant that
he/she/it hasaspecific time tofile
ananswer orother response. Acopy
ofthecomplaint andthesummons
must beserved onadefendant be-
forearesponse isrequired. Under a
unique statute, New York allows
asummons tobeserved without a
complaint. Acomplaint filingmust
beaccompanied byafiling fee
payable tothecourt clerk, unless a
waiver based onpoverty isobtained.

compound interest: n.payment of
interest upon principal andprevi-
ously accumulated interest, which
increases theamount paid for
money useabove simple interest.
Thus, itcanincrease more rapidly
ifcompounded daily, monthly or

Most lenders agree. (See: interest,

tionofmore than onequestion into
what seems tobeasingle question
asked ofawitness during atrial or
deposition. Acompound question can
beobjected tobyopposing counsel
since itisconfusing tothewitness,
who isentitled toanswer each ques-
tion separately. Iftheobjection is
sustained thequestion must bewith-
drawn andasked inaseries ofsepa-
ratequestions. (See:objection)
compromise: 1)n.anagreement be-
tween opposing parties tosettle a
dispute orreach asettlement in
which each gives some ground,
rather than continue thedispute or
gototrial. Judges encourage com-
promise and settlement, which is
often economically sensible, since it
avoids mounting attorneys’ feesand
costs. 2)v.toreach asettlement in
which each party givesupsome de-
mands. (See:settlement)
compromise verdict: n.adecision
made byajury inwhich thejurors
splitthedifference between thehigh
amount ofdamages which onegroup
ofjurors feel isjustified andthelow
amount other jurors favor. Since this
isa“chance” verdict notcomputed on
acareful determination ofthedam-
ages, itmaydoaninjustice toone
party ortheother, and isthusmis-
conduct, which canresult inanap-
peals court overturning theverdict.

nications between husband andwife,
lawyer and client, physician orother
medical person (most therapists) and
patient, minister orpriest andparish-
ioner (oranyone seeking spiritual
help), andjournalist andsource in
some states. Moral conflicts may arise
when amurderer orchild molester

conscientious objector
“significant other”) inaspecial room
orapartment.
conscientious objector: n.aperson
whorefuses toserve inthemilitary
duetoreligious orstrong philosoph-
icalviews against war orkilling.
Refusing toanswer adraft call isa
federal felony, butwhen aperson’s
religious beliefs arelong-standing
andconsistent (aswith theQuak-
ers)then theobjection toservice is
excused. Conscientious objectors
mayberequired toperform some
non-violent work likedriving an
ambulance. During theVietnam
Warsome conscientious objectors
fledtoCanada toavoidanyservice.
However, heavyweight boxing
champion Muhammad Alirefused
induction during theVietnam War
(1967) onthebasis ofhisBlack
Muslim religious beliefs against
warandother philosophical rea-
sons, butwascharged with draft
evasion anyway. Aliwasconvicted
andsentenced tofiveyears in
prison. OnJune 28,1971, the
Supreme Court overturned Ali’s
conviction. Those whodonotagree
with these objectors sometimes call
them “draft dodgers.”

consideration: n.1)payment or
money. 2)avitalelement inthelaw
ofcontracts, consideration isabene-
fitwhich must bebargained forbe-
tween theparties, and istheessen-
tialreason foraparty entering intoa
contract. Consideration must beof
value (atleast totheparties), and is
exchanged fortheperformance or
promise ofperformance bytheother
party (such performance itself iscon-
sideration). Inacontract, oneconsid-
eration (thing given) isexchanged
foranother consideration. Notdoing
anact(forbearance) canbeconsider-
ation, such as“Iwillpayyou$1,000
nottobuild aroadnext tomyfence.”
Sometimes consideration is“nomi-
nal,”meaning itisstated forform
only, such as“$10 asconsideration
forconveyance oftitle,” which is
used tohide thetrueamount being
paid. Contracts maybecome unen-
forceable orrescindable (undone by
rescission) for“failure ofconsidera-
tion”when theintended considera-
tion isfound tobeworth lessthan
expected, isdamaged ordestroyed,
orperformance isnotmade properly
(aswhen themechanic does not
make thecarrun properly). Acts
which areillegal orsoimmoral that
they areagainst established public
policy cannot serve asconsideration
forenforceable contracts. Examples:

basis foralldecisions bytheU.S.
Supreme Court (and federal and

The case ofMarbury v.Madison
(1803) firmly established thepower
oftheSupreme Court tostrikedown
federal statutes itfound unconstitu-
tional, making theSupreme Court
thefinal arbiter ofconstitutional in-
terpretation. The“equal rights” pro-
vision ofthe14thAmendment
established that therights inthe
first tenamendments (“Bill of
Rights”) applied tostate govern-
ments. Unfortunately, state consti-
tutions have gathered tremendous
amounts ofbaggage ofdetail by
amendment overtheyears, and itis
more difficult to“fine tune” stateconstitutions byfurther amendment
than itistoenact statutes (passnew
laws). However, state courts are
bound bytheir state’s constitution on
fundamental issues. The so-called
English constitution isanunwritten
body oflegal customs andrights de-
veloped bypractice andcourt deci-
sionsfromthe11th tothe18thCentu-
ry.(See: BillofRights, common

upagencies toprotect theconsumer
(the retail purchasers ofgoods and
services) from inferior, adulterated,
hazardous ordeceptively advertised
products, anddeceptive orfraudu-
lentsales practices. Federal statutes
andregulations govern mail fraud,
wholesome poultry andmeat, mis-
branding andadulteration offood
andcosmetics, truth inlending, false
advertising, thesoundness ofbanks,
securities sales, standards ofhous-
ingmaterials, flammable fabrics,
andvarious business practices. The
Magnuson-Moss Act (1973) sets
minimum standards forproduct
warranties, makes acompany that
financed thesale responsible for
product defects, andcreates liability(financial responsibility) for“implied”
warranties (when thecircumstances
show thatawarranty oflackofdefects
wasintended) aswellasexpress (spe-
cific) warranties. Mail fraudmay in-
clude fake contests, “low-ball” price
traps (baitandswitch), supposed cred-
itforreferrals ofyour friends, phoney
home improvement loans withhuge
finalpayments, andswamp land sales.
Some states’ laws regulate andgive
some protection against high-pressure
door-to-door sales, false labeling, unso-
licited merchandise, abusive collection
practices, misleading advertising and
referral andpromotional sales. Almost
allstates have agencies setuptoac-

Incarceration isgenerally just a
threat and ifimposed, usually
brief. Since thejudge has discre-
tion tocontrol thecourtroom, con-
tempt citations aregenerally not
appealable unless theamount of

contract: 1)n.anagreement with spe-
cificterms between twoormore per-
sons orentities inwhich there isa
promise todosomething inreturn for
avaluable benefit known asconsider-
ation. Since thelawofcontracts isat
theheart ofmost business dealings,
itisoneofthethree orfourmost sig-
nificant areas oflegal concern and
caninvolve variations oncircum-
stances andcomplexities. The exis-
tence ofacontract requires finding
thefollowing factual elements: a)an
offer; b)anacceptance ofthat offer
which results inameeting ofthe
minds; c)apromise toperform; d)a
valuable consideration (which canbe
apromise orpayment insome form);
e)atime oreventwhen performance
must bemade (meet commitments);
f)terms andconditions forperfor-
mance, including fulfilling promises;
g)performance, ifthecontract is
“unilateral”. Aunilateral contract is
oneinwhich there isapromise topay
orgiveother consideration inreturn
foractual performance. (Iwillpay
you$500 tofixmycarbyThursday;
theperformance isfixing thecarby
that date.)Abilateral contract isone
inwhich apromise isexchanged fora
promise. (Ipromise tofixyour carby
Thursday andyoupromise topay
$500onThursday.) Contracts canbe
either written ororal,butoral con-
tracts aremore difficult toprove and
inmost jurisdictions thetime tosue

years forwritten). Insome cases a
contract canconsist ofseveral doc-
uments, such asaseries ofletters,
orders, offers and counteroffers.
There areavariety oftypes ofcon-
tracts: “conditional” onanevent oc-
curring; “joint and several,” in
which several parties make ajoint
promise toperform, buteach isre-
sponsible; “implied,” inwhich the

ments, buy alltheproducts made,

dent.Under this rule,abadly injured
person whowasonly slightly negli-

Cooperatives include dairy milk
producers, cotton ginsand thou-

sizes. There arealsocooperatives in
which consumers form retail outlets
likegrocery stores andshare the
profits based ontheamount ofpa-

have found itdifficult tocompete
withthegiant supermarket chains.
Some cooperatives exist tooperate
housing complexes. (See:coopera-

cooperative housing: n.an
arrangement inwhich anassocia-

own ashare inthecooperative
which entitles them tooccupy an
apartment (ortown house) asif
theywere owners, tohave equal
access tothecommon areas and
tovote formembers oftheboard
ofdirectors which manages the
cooperative. Acooperative differs
fromacondominium project inthat
theowners ofthecondominium
units actually own their airspaceandapercentage interest inthecom-
mon area. Inacooperative there are
often restrictions ontransfer of
shares such asgiving priority to
other members, limits onincome or
maximum sales price. (See:common

such improper appropriation (use)
oftheopportunity onthetheory that
the official holds itin“constructive
trust” forthecorporation. Thecorpo-
rationmayobtain aninjunction (court

sontocarry onbusiness (orother
activities), which cansueorbe
sued, and(unless itisnon-profit)
canissue shares ofstock toraise
funds withwhich tostart abusi-

benefit isthat acorporation’s lia-

edtoitsassets, sothesharehold-
ersand officers areprotected from
personal claims, unless theycom-
mit fraud. Forprivate business
corporations thearticles ofincor-

must include certain information,
including thename oftherespon-
sible party orparties (incorpora-
torsandagent foracceptance of
service), theamount ofstock itwill
beauthorized toissue, and itspur-
pose. Insome states thepurpose
maybeageneral statement ofany
purpose allowed bylaw,while oth-
ersrequire greater specificity. Cor-
poration shareholders elect a
board ofdirectors, which inturn
adopts bylaws, chooses theofficers
andhires topmanagement (which
insmaller corporations areoften
thedirectors and/or shareholders).
Annual meetings arerequired of
both theshareholders and the
board, andmajor policy decisions
must bemade byresolution ofthe
board (which often delegates much
authority toofficers andcommit-tees). Issuance ofstock oflessthan
$300,000, withnopublic solicitation
and relatively fewshareholders, is
either automatically approved bythe
state commissioner ofcorporations
orrequires apetition outlining the
financing. Some states areconsid-

corporations must register with Sec-

byadefendant against aplaintiff in
alawsuit included inthedefen-

counterclaims thatHotdog oweshim
$20,000 foraload ofbadchicken liv-
ers, soHotdog isonly entitled to
$20,000. Inmany states thecounter-
claim isnolonger allowed, inwhich
caseacross-complaint, which isasep-
arate complaint, must befiledbythe
defendant, butaspart ofthesame
lawsuit. Ontheother hand, infederal

ceives the offerand gives Seller a
counter offer of$140,000, payable in
45days.The original offer isdead,

court: n.1)thejudge, asin“The court
rules infavor oftheplaintiff.” 2)any
official tribunal (court) presided
overbyajudge orjudges inwhich
legal issues andclaims areheard
and determined. IntheUnited
States there areessentially twosys-
tems: federal courts and state
courts. Thebasic federal court sys-
temhasjurisdiction over cases in-
volving federal statutes, constitu-
tional questions, actions between
citizens ofdifferent states, and cer-
tainother types ofcases. Itstrial
courts areDistrict Courts inoneor
more districts perstate, overwhich
there areDistrict Courts ofAppeal
(usually three-judge panels) tohear
appeals fromjudgments oftheDis-
trict Courts within the “circuit.”
There are10geographic circuitsthroughout thenation. Appeals on
constitutional questions andother sig-
nificant cases areheard bythe
Supreme Court, butonly ifthatcourt
agrees tohearthecase.There arealso
special federal courts such asbank-
ruptcy andtaxcourts withappeals di-
rected totheDistrict Courts.
Each state has local trial courts,
which include courts formisde-
meanors (non-penitentiary crimes),
smaller demand civil actions (called
municipal, city,justice orsome other
designation), andthen courts, usually
setupineachcounty (variously called
Superior, District, County, Common
Pleas courts and called Supreme
Court inNew York) tohear felonies
(crimes punished bystate prison
terms), estates, divorces andmajor
lawsuits. Thehighest state court is
called theState Supreme Court, ex-
cept inNew York andMaryland,
which callthem Court ofAppeals.
Some 29states have intermediate ap-
peals courts which hearappeals from
trial courts which willresult infinal
decisions unless theState Supreme
Court chooses toconsider thematter.
Some states have speciality courts
such asfamily, surrogate anddomes-
ticrelations. Small claims courts are
anadjunct ofthelowest courts han-
dling lesser disputes (although Cali-
fornia’s limit is$5,000) withnorepre-
sentation byattorneys andshortand
somewhat informal trials conducted
byjudges, commissioners orlawyers.

court ofequity: n.originally inEnglish
common lawand inseveral states

without thetime forcontemplation
orallowing for“acooling ofthe

gathered, arrests made, charges
brought, defenses raised, trials con-
ducted, sentences rendered andpun-
ishment carried out.

cross-complaint
cross-complaint: n.after acom-
plaint hasbeen filed against ade-
fendant fordamages orother or-
ders ofthecourt, thedefendant
may fileawritten complaint
against theparty suing him/her or
against athird party aslongasthe
subject matter isrelated tothe
original complaint. Thedefendant’s
filing ofacomplaint iscalled a
cross-complaint, andthedefendant
isthen called across-complainant
andtheparty he/she sues iscalled
across-defendant. Thedefendant
must still fileananswer orother
response totheoriginal complaint.
Ifthecross-complaint isagainst
theoriginal plaintiff (original suer)
then itcanbeserved ontheplain-
tiff’s attorney bymail, butathird
party must beserved inperson
withthecross-complaint andanew
summons issued bytheclerk ofthe
court. Thecross-defendants must
then fileanswers orother respons-
es.These arecalled pleadings and
must becarefully drafted (usually
byanattorney) toproperly state
thefactual aswellaslegal basis for
theclaim andcontain aprayer for
damages orother relief. (See: an-
swer, complaint, demurrer,
pleading, prayer, service of
process, summons)
cross-examination: n.theopportu-
nity fortheattorney (oranunrep-
resented party) toaskquestions in
court ofawitness whohastestified
inatrialonbehalf oftheopposing
party.Thequestions oncross-exam-
ination arelimited tothesubjects
covered inthedirect examination of
thewitness, butimportantly, the
attorney may askleading ques-
tions, inwhich he/she isallowed tosuggest answers orputwords inthe
witness’s mouth. (Forexample, “Isn’t
ittrue thatyoutoldMrs.Jones she
haddone nothing wrong?” which is
leading, ascompared to“Didyousay
anything toMrs. Jones?”) Astrong
cross-examination (often called just
“cross” bylawyers andjudges) can
force contradictions, expressions of
doubts oreven complete obliteration
ofawitness’s prior carefully re-
hearsed testimony. Ontheother
hand, repetition ofawitness’ sstory,
vehemently defended, canstrengthen
his/her credibility. (See: credibility,
direct examination, testimony,
trial, witness)
cruel andunusual punishment: n.
governmental penalties against con-
victed criminal defendants which are
barbaric, involve torture and/or shock
thepublic morality. They arespecifi-
cally prohibited under theEighth
Amendment totheU.S.Constitution.
However, nowhere arethey specifical-
lydefined. Tortures like therack
(stretching thebody inchbyinch) or
thethumbscrew, dismemberment,
breaking bones, maiming, actions in-
volving deep orlong-lasting pain are
allbanned. Butsolitary confinement,
enforced silence, necessary force to
prevent injury tofellow prisoners or
guards, psychological humiliation
andbadfoodaregenerally allowed. In
short, there isalarge gray area, in
which “cruel andunusual” isdefinite-
lysubjective based onindividual sen-
sitivities andmoral outlook. TheU.S.
Supreme Court haswaffled onthe
death penalty, declaring thatsome
forms ofthepenalty were crueland
prohibited under theFurman case
(1972), which halted executions for
several years, butlater relaxed the
124

cumulative sentence
prohibition. Thequestion remains
ifthegaschamber, hanging or
electrocution arecruelandunusu-
al.Forinstance, hanging iscertain-
lycruel butwasnotunusual atthe
timetheBillofRights wasadopted.
(See:capital punishment,)
cruelty: n.theintentional andmali-
cious infliction ofphysical orpsy-
chological painonanother. Inmost
states various forms of“cruelty,”
“extreme cruelty,” and/or “mental
cruelty” used tobegrounds fordi-
vorce ifproved. Thisbrought about
alotofunnecessary (and some-
times exaggerated orfalse) deroga-
tory (nasty) testimony about the
other party. There was little stan-
dardization ofwhat constituted suf-
ficient “cruelty” toprove adivorce
should begranted. Starting inthe
1960s “nofault” divorce (sometimes
now called “dissolution”) began to
replace contentious divorces in
most states, sothatincompatibility
became goodenough grounds for
granting adivorce. (See:crueland
unusual punishment, dissolu-
tionofmarriage, divorce)
cruelty toanimals: n.thecrime of
inflicting physical pain, suffering
ordeath onananimal, usually a
tame one,beyond necessity fornor-
mal discipline. Itcaninclude ne-
glect that issomonstrous (with-
holding foodandwater) that the
animal hassuffered, died orbeen
putinimminent danger ofdeath.
(See: cruelty)
culpability: (See:culpable)
culpable: adj.sufficiently responsi-
bleforcriminal actsornegligencetobeatfaultand liable forthecon-
duct.Sometimes culpability restson
whether theperson realized the
wrongful nature ofhis/her actions
andthusshould taketheblame.
Justice delayed isjustice de-
nied.—Anonymous, oftenquoted
cumis counsel: n.anattorney em-
ployed byadefendant inalawsuit
when there isaninsurance policy
supposedly covering theclaim, but
there isaconflict ofinterest between
theinsurance company andthe in-
sured defendant. Such aconflict
might arise iftheinsurance compa-
nyisdenying fullcoverage. Insome
states (notably California) thedefen-
dantcandemand thattheinsurance
company paythefeesofhis/her own
attorney rather than useaninsur-
ancecompany lawyer. Often thein-
surance company willrequire that
theattorney forthedefendant beap-
proved bythecompany.
cumulative sentence: n.when a
criminal defendant hasbeen found
guilty ofmore thanoneoffense, the
judge may sentence him/her to
prison forsuccessive terms foreach
crime (e.g. fiveyears forburglary,
three years forpossession ofstolen
property, which addupandaccumu-
late toeight years). Theother choice
would betosentence thedefendant
toaconcurrent sentence, inwhich
the lesser term would bemerged
with thelonger, theywould runat
thesame time,andthus result ina
five-year term intheexample. (See:
concurrent sentence, successive
terms)

cumulative voting
cumulative voting: n.incorpora-
tions, asystem ofvoting byshare-
holders fordirectors inwhich the
shareholder canmultiply hisvot-
ingshares bythenumber ofcandi-
dates andvotethem allforone
person fordirector. This isintend-
edtogiveminority shareholders a
chance toelect atleastonedirector
whom they favor. Forexample,
there arefivedirectors tobeelect-
ed,and 10,000 shares issued, a
shareholder with 1,000 shares
could vote5,000 forhiscandidate
rather than being limited to1,000
foreach offivecandidates, always
outvoted byshareholders with
1,001 ormore shares.

cutacheck: v.towrite (prepare) and

cypres doctrine: n.(see-pray doc-
trine) from French, meaning “as
close aspossible.” When agift is
made bywillortrust (usually for
charitable oreducational purposes),
andthenamed recipient ofthe gift
does notexist, hasdissolved orno
longer conducts the activity for
which thegift ismade, then thees-
tateortrustee mustmake thegiftto
anorganization which comes closest
tofulfilling thepurpose ofthe gift.
Sometimes this results inheated
court disputes inwhich ajudge must
determine theappropriate substi-
tute toreceive the gift.Example:
dozens oflocal Societies forProtec-
tionofCruelty toAnimals contested
foragiftwhich wasmade without
designating which chapter would re-
ceive thebenefits. Thejudge wisely
divided upthemoney among several
S.P.C.A. chapters.

damages: n.theamount ofmoney
which aplaintiff (theperson suing)
maybeawarded inalawsuit. There
aremany types ofdamages. Special
damages arethose which actually
were caused bytheinjury and in-
clude medical and hospital bills,
ambulance charges, lossofwages,
property repair orreplacement
costs orlossofmoney dueonacon-
tract.Thesecond basic area ofdam-
ages aregeneral damages, which
arepresumed tobearesult ofthe
other party’s actions, butaresub-
jective both innature anddetermi-
nation ofvalue ofdamages. These
include painand suffering, future
problems andcrippling effect ofan
injury, lossofability toperform var-
ious acts, shortening oflifespan,
mental anguish, lossofcompanion-
ship, lossofreputation (inalibel
suit, forexample), humiliation from
scars, loss ofanticipated business
andother harm. The third major
form ofdamage isexemplary (or
punitive) damages, which combines
punishment andthesetting ofpub-
licexample. Exemplary damages
maybeawarded when thedefen-
dant acted inamalicious, violent,
oppressive, fraudulent, wanton or
grossly reckless way incausing the
special andgeneral damages tothe
plaintiff. Onoccasion punitive dam-
agescanbegreater than theactual
damages, as,forexample, inasex-
ualharassment case orfraudulent
schemes. Although often asked for,they areseldom awarded. Nominal
damages arethose givenwhen theac-
tualharm isminor andanaward is
warranted under thecircumstances.
Themostfamous casewaswhen Win-
stonChurchill wasawarded ashilling
(about 25cents) against author Louis
Adamic, whohadwritten that the
British Prime Minister hadbeen
drunk atadinner attheWhite
House. Liquidated damages arethose

woman, during avoluntary social
engagement inwhich thewoman
didnotintend tosubmit tothesex-

byverbal refusals, denials orpleas
tostop, and/or physical resistance.
The factthattheparties knew each

ruled thattherehad tobesome ac-
tualphysical resistance. (See:rape)
day incourt: n.popular term for

taryofState orsome other official to
inform thepublic astotherealper-

which can kill.This includes not
onlyweapons which areintended todoharm likeagunorknife, butalso
blunt instruments likeclubs, baseball

when trying toprove criminal charges
brought forassault with adeadly
weapon. Inafew1990s cases courts
havefound rocksandeven penises of
AIDS sufferers as“deadly weapons.”

laration, ismade. Thedeclaration is
morecommonly used than the affi-
davit, which issimilar toadeclaration
butrequires taking anoath toswear
tothetruth attested to(certified in
writing) byanotary public. Intheory,
adeclarant whoknowingly does not

areas ofthelaw,theterm decree is
either morecommon orpreferred as
inprobates ofestates, domestic rela-

decriminalization: n.therepeal or
amendment ofstatutes which made
certain acts criminal, sothatthose
actsnolonger arecrimes subject to
prosecution. Many states have de-
criminalized certain sexual practices
between consenting adults, “loiter-
ing”(hanging outwithout anycrimi-
nalactivity), oroutmoded racist laws
against miscegenation (marriage or
cohabitation between people ofdif-
ferent races). Currently, there isa
130

deed oftrust
considerable movement toward de-
criminalization oftheuseofsome
narcotics (particularly marijuana)
byadults, onvarious grounds, in-
cluding individual rights andcon-
tention that decriminalization
would take the profit outofthe
drug trade bymaking drugs avail-
able through clinics andother
legal sources.
dedication: n.thegiving oflandby

dedication before itiscomplete. In
many cases there are“dedicated”
streets onoldsubdivision maps
which werenever officially accept-

Theadjoining property owners can
sue forajudgment togivethem

deduction: n.anexpenditure which
anincome taxpayermay subtract

together, reduce thetaxowed.
deed: 1)n.thewritten document
which transfers title(ownership) or

transferring theproperty (grantor),
theparty receiving theproperty
(grantee) andbesigned bythegrantor,
whomust thenacknowledge before a
notary public that he/she/it executed
thedeed. Tocomplete thetransfer
(conveyance) thedeedmust berecord-
edintheoffice oftheCounty Recorder
orRecorder ofDeeds. There aretwo
basic types ofdeeds: awarranty deed,
which guarantees that thegrantor
owns title, andthequitclaim deed,
which transfers only that interest in
therealproperty which thegrantor ac-
tually has.Thequitclaim isoftenused
among family members orfrom one
jointowner totheotherwhen there is
little question about existing owner-
ship, orjust toclear the title. This is
nottobeconfused withadeed oftrust,
which isaform ofmortgage. 2)v.to

deed oftrust: n.adocument which
pledges real property tosecure a
loan, used instead ofamortgage in
Alaska, Arizona, California, Col-

Carolina, Texas, Virginia andWest
Virginia. Theproperty isdeeded by
thetitleholder (trustor) toatrustee
(often atitle orescrow company)
which holds thetitle intrust forthe
beneficiary (the lender ofthe
money). When theloan isfully paid,
thetrustor requests thetrustee to
return the titlebyreconveyance. If
theloanbecomes delinquent theben-
eficiary can fileanotice ofdefault
and, iftheloan isnotbrought cur-
rent, candemand that thetrustee
begin foreclosure ontheproperty so

others may survive. Some demur-
rerscontend that thecomplaint is

committing, particularly murder or
attempted murder. Itisraised bythe
defense inattempts toremove theele-
ment ofpremeditation orcriminal in-
tentandthusobtain aconviction fora
lesser crime, suchasmanslaughter in-
stead ofmurder. While thetheory has
some legitimacy, attimes juries have
been overly impressed bypsychiatric

was inPeople v.Dan White, thead-

easement: n.theright tousethereal
property ofanother foraspecific
purpose. Theeasement isitself a

cess toanother property (often re-
dundantly stated “access and
egress,” since entry and exitare
over thesame path), forutility or
sewer lines bothunder andabove
ground, useofspring water, entry to
make repairs onafence orslide

owner forastatutory number of
years, typically five (“prescriptive
easement”), ortodoequity (fair-
ness), including giving access toa
“land-locked” piece ofproperty
(sometimes called an“easement of

specifically described byboundaries
(“24 feetwide along thenorthern
line foradistance of180 feet”),
somewhat indefinite (“along the
trail tothenorthern boundary”) or
just forapurpose (“toprovide accesstotheJones property” or“access tothe

easement.” There isalsoa“negative
easement” such asaprohibition
against building astructure which
blocks aview. Title reports and title

he/she really wants topursue, usu-
allyjustbefore thetrialbegins. Ex-
ample: suing someone forboth
breach ofcontract and forfraud (a
secret plannottofulfill thecontract
when itwasmade). Fraud might
bring punitive damages, butproof

governmental entity (federal, state,
county orcitygovernment, school
district, hospital district orother
agencies) totake private real es-
tate forpublic use,with orwithout
thepermission oftheowner. The
FifthAmendment totheConstitu-
tionprovides that“private property
[may not]betaken forpublic use
without just compensation.” The
Fourteenth Amendment added the
requirement ofjustcompensation
tostateand localgovernment tak-
ings.Theusual process includes
passage ofaresolution bytheac-
quiring agency totaketheproperty
(condemnation), including adecla-
ration ofpublic need, followed by
anappraisal, anoffer,andthen ne-
gotiation. Iftheowner isnotsatis-
fied, he/she may suethegovern-mental agency foracourt’s determi-
nation ofjustcompensation. Thegov-
ernment, however, becomes owner
while atrial ispending iftheamount
oftheoffer isdeposited inatrust ac-
count. Public uses include schools,
streets andhighways, parks, air-
ports, dams, reservoirs, redevelop-

emotional distress: n.anincreasingly
popular basis foraclaim ofdamages
inlawsuits forinjury duetothenegli-

Originally damages foremotional dis-
tresswere onlyawardable inconjunc-
tionwithdamages foractual physical
harm. Recently courts inmany states,
including NewYorkand California,
have recognized aright toanaward of
money damages foremotional distress
without physical injury orcontact. In
sexual harassment claims, emotional
distress canbethemajor, oreven only,
harmful result. Inmost jurisdictions,
emotional distress cannot beclaimed
forbreach ofcontract orother busi-
ness activity, butcanbealleged in
cases oflibelandslander. Evidentiary
problems include thefactthatsuch
distress iseasily feigned orexaggerat-
ed,andprofessional testimony bya

quired tovalidate theexistence and
depth ofthedistress andplace adollar
value upon it.(See:damages)

encouragement ofthecriminal act
155

entry ofjudgment
originated withthepolice orgovern-
ment agents instead ofwith the
“criminal.” Entrapment, ifproved, is
adefense toacriminal prosecution.
Theaccused often claims entrap-
ment inso-called “stings” inwhich
undercover agents buyorsellnar-
cotics, prostitutes’ services or
arrange topurchase goods believed
tobestolen. Thefactual question is:
Would Johnny Begood have pur-

rollofjudgments.
environmental impact report: n.a
study ofallthefactors which aland
development orconstruction project
would have ontheenvironment in
thearea, including population, traf-
fic,schools, fireprotection, endan-

states require such reports besub-
mitted tolocalgovernments before
thedevelopment orproject canbe
approved, unless thegovernmental

stateandfederal statutes intended
toprotect the environment,
wildlife, landandbeauty, prevent
pollution orover-cutting offorests,
saveendangered species, conserve
water, develop andfollow general

mental effects ontheenvironment.
equal opportunity: 1)n.aright sup-

origin, ageorhandicap. Aperson who
believes he/she hasnotbeen granted
equal opportunity orhasbeen out-
right sexually harassed ordiscrimi-
nated against may bring alawsuit
under federal andmost state laws, or
fileacomplaint withthefederal Equal
Opportunity Employment Commis-
sion orastate equal opportunity

ployers, lenders and landlords, who
advertise thatthey are“equal oppor-
tunity employers,” subtly suggesting

equal protection ofthelaw: n.the
right ofallpersons tohave thesame ac-
cess tothelawandcourts and tobe
treated equally bythelawandcourts,
both inprocedures and inthesub-
stance ofthelaw. Itisakin totheright
todueprocess oflaw,butinparticular
applies toequal treatment asanele-
ment offundamental fairness. The
most famous caseonthesubject is
Brown v.Board ofEducation oflhpeka
(1954) inwhich Chief Justice EarlWar-
ren, foraunanimous Supreme Court,
ruled that“separate butequal” educa-
tional facilities forblacks were inher-
ently unequal and unconstitutional
since thesegregated school system did
156

ergo
notgive allstudents equal rights
under thelaw. Itwill alsoapply to
other inequalities such asdifferen-
tials inpayforthesamework orun-
equal taxation. Theprinciple isstat-
edinthe14thAmendment tothe
Constitution: “NoState shall... deny
toanyperson within itsjurisdiction
theequal protection ofthelaws.”
(See:dueprocess oflaw)
equitable: adj. 1)just,based onfair-

equitable estoppel: n.where acourt
willnotgrant ajudgment orother
legal relief toapartywhohasnot
acted fairly; forexample, byhaving
made false representations orcon-
cealing material facts from the
other party. This illustrates the
legalmaxim: “hewhoseeks equity,
must doequity.” Example: Larry
Landlord rents space toDora Dress-
maker inhisshopping center but
falsely tellsheraSears store willbe
atenant andwilldraw customers to
theproject. Hedoes not tellhera
newfreeway isgoing todivert traf-

equitable lien: n.alienonproperty
imposed byacourt inorder to
achieve fairness, particularly when
someone haspossession ofproperty
which he/she holds foranother. (See:

calrequirements ofthelaw.Inessence
courts dothefairthingbycourt orders
such ascorrection ofproperty lines,
taking possession ofassets, imposing
alien, dividing assets, orinjunctive
relief (ordering aperson todosome-
thing) toprevent irreparable damage.
Therules ofequity arose inEngland
where the strict limitations ofcom-
monlawwould notsolve allproblems,
sotheKing setupcourts ofchancery
(equity) toprovide remedies through
theroyal power. Most eastern states
hadcourts ofequity orchancery sepa-
ratefrom courts oflaw,andothers had
parallel systems oflawandequity
with different procedural rules.Now
most states combine lawandequity
andtreat bothunder “onecause ofac-
tion.” 2)thenetvalue ofrealproperty,
determined bysubtracting the
amount ofunpaid debts secured by
(against) theproperty from theap-
praised value oftheproperty. (See:

excessive bail
Comments andarguments bytheat-
torneys, statements bythejudge
andanswers toquestions which the
judge hasruled objectionable arenot
evidence. Charts, maps andmodels
which areused todemonstrate or
explain matters arenotevidence
themselves, buttestimony based
upon such items andmarks on
such material may beevidence.
Evidence must survive objections of
opposing attorneys that itisirrele-
vant, immaterial orviolates rules
against “hearsay” (statements bya
party not incourt), and/or other
technicalities. (See:circumstantial
evidence, competency, demon-
strative evidence, deposition,
hearsay, material, object, objec-
tion, relevant)
examination: n.1)thequestioning of
awitness byanattorney. Direct ex-
amination isinterrogation bytheat-
torney who called thewitness, and
cross-examination isquestioning by
theopposing attorney. Aprincipal
difference isthat anattorney
putting questions tohisown wit-
nesscannot ask“leading” questions,
which putwords inthemouth ofthe
witness orsuggest theanswer,
while oncross-examination he/she
canpose aquestion thatseems to
contain ananswer orsuggest lan-
guage forthewitness touseoragree
to.2)inbankruptcy, thequestions
asked ofadebtor bythejudge,
trustee inbankruptcy, attorneys or
even creditors, todetermine the
state ofthedebtor’s affairs. 3)in
criminal law,apreliminary exami-
nation isahearing before ajudge or
other magistrate todetermine
whether adefendant charged witha
felony should beheld fortrial.Usu-allythis isheldbyalower courtand if
there isanysubstantial evidence to
show afelony hasbeencommitted by
thedefendant he/she isbound over to
theappropriate court for trial, but
otherwise thecharge willbedismissed
bythejudge. (See: bankruptcy,

nation, testimony, witness)
exception: n.1)aformal objection dur-
ingtrial(“We take exception, orsim-
ply,“exception”)” totheruling ofa
judge onanymatter, including rulings
onobjections toevidence, toshow toa
higher court thatthelawyer didnot
agree withtheruling. Inmodem prac-
tice, itisnotnecessary “totakeexcep-
tion” toajudge’s adverse ruling, since
itisnowassumed thattheattorney
against whom theruling ismade ob-
jects. This alsokeeps thetranscribed
record from being cluttered with
shouts of“exception.” 2)incontracts,
statutes ordeeds, astatement that
some matter isnotincluded. (See: ex-
ception indeed)
exception indeed: n.anotation ina
deed oftitle torealproperty which
states that certain interests, such as
easements, mineral rights oralifees-
tate, arenotincluded inthetransfer
(conveyance) oftitle.
excessive bail: n.anamount ofbailor-
dered posted byanaccused defendant
which ismuchmorethannecessary or
usual toassure he/she willmake court
appearances, particularly inrelation

motion forreduction ofbail,and if
itisnotgranted, he/she canthen
apply directly toacourt ofappeal for
reduction. (See: bail)

exclusionary rule: n.therulethat
evidence secured byillegal means
and inbad faith cannot beintro-
duced inacriminal trial.Thetech-
nicalterm isthat itis“excluded”
upon amotion tosuppress made by
thelawyer fortheaccused. Itis
based ontheconstitutional re-
quirement that “...no [person] can
bedeprived oflife, liberty, orprop-
erty, without dueprocess oflaw”
(FifthAmendment totheConstitu-
tion, applied tothestates by14th
Amendment). Atechnical error ina
search warrant made ingood faith
willnotcause exclusion oftheevi-
dence obtained under that war-
rant. In1995 theU.S.Supreme
Court ruled thatevidence obtained
withawarrant thathadbeen can-
celled could beadmitted ifthelaw
enforcement officer believed itwas
still inforce. However, evidence
which wasuncovered asaresult ofobtaining other evidence illegally will
beexcluded, under the“fruit ofthe
poisonous tree doctrine.” Thus, ifan
illegal wiretapreveals thelocation of
other evidence, boththetranscript of
thewiretapconversation andtheev-
idence towhich thelisteners were di-
rected willbeexcluded. (See:due

aside adefault judgment forfailure to
answer (orotherwise respond) inthe
period setbylaw. Illness, press of
business bythelawyer (butnotnec-
essarily thedefendant), oranunder-
standable oversight bythelawyer’s
staff (“just blame thesecretary”) are
common excuses which thecourts will
often accept. However, ifthedefen-
dant loses thecomplaint orfails to
callhis/her attorney thecourts willbe
lesslenient. Inanyevent, thedefen-

expost facto-, adj.Latin for“after the
fact,” which refers tolawsadopted
afteranactiscommitted making it
illegal although itwas legalwhen

failure ofconsideration: n.not
delivering goods orservices when
promised inacontract. When
goods aparty hadbargained for

rectdescendants.
faircomment: n.astatement ofopin-

false arrest: n.physically detaining
someone without thelegal right to
doso.Quite often thisinvolves pri-
vate security people orother owners
oremployees ofretail establish-
ments who holdsomeone without
having seen acrime committed in
their presence orpretend thatthey
arepolice officers. While theymay
beentitled tomake a“citizen’s ar-
rest” theyhadbetter besure that
theyhaveaperson whohascommit-
tedacrime, andtheymust calllaw
enforcement officers totakeover at
thefirstopportunity. Othercommonfalse arrest situations include an
arrest byapolice officer ofthewrong
person orwithout probable cause to
believe acrime hasbeen committed
and/or without awarrant. Onlywhen
thearresting party knowingly holds
someone whohasnotcommitted a
crime, isthefalse arrest itself acrime.
However, probable false arrest canbe
thebasis ofalawsuit fordamages, in-
cluding mental distress andembar-
rassment. (See: falseimprisonment)
false imprisonment: n.depriving
someone offreedom ofmovement by
holding aperson inaconfined space or
byphysical restraint including being
locked inacar,driven about without
opportunity togetout,being tied toa
chair orlocked inacloset. Itmaybe
thefollow-up toafalse arrest (holding
someone intheoffice ofadepartment
store, forexample), butmore often it
resembles akidnapping withnobelief
orclaim ofalegal right tohold the
person. Therefore, falseimprisonment
isoftenacrime and ifproved isalmost
always thebasis ofalawsuit fordam-
ages. (See: false arrest)
false pretenses: n.thecrime ofknow-
ingly making untrue statements for
thepurpose ofobtaining money or

family purpose doctrine: n.arule
oflawthattheregistered owner of
anautomobile isresponsible for
damages toanyone injured when
theauto isdriven byamember of
thefamily with orwithout the
owner’s permission. Thetheory of
this liability isthat thevehicle is

federal courts: n.thecourt system
which handles civilandcriminal

federal district courts which are
trial courts, district courts ofap-
pealsandtheU.S.Supreme Court,
aswell asspecialized courts such
asbankruptcy, tax,claims (against

peals. (See:bankruptcy, appen-

court isthat itisbased onsubjects
enumerated intheU.S. Constitu-
tionorwhen afederal statute isin-
volved. Thus, existence ofsuch a
federal question gives thefederal

(1948) which removed thepower of
thefederal government toclaim im-

felon: n.aperson whohasbeen con-
victed ofafelony, which isacrime
punishable bydeath oraterm in
state orfederal prison. (See:felony)
felonious: adj. referring toanact
donewithcriminal intent. Theterm
isused todistinguish between a
wrong which wasnotmalicious, and
anintentional crime, asin“felo-
nious assault,” which isanattack
meant todorealharm.
felony: n.1)acrime sufficiently seri-
oustobepunishable bydeath ora
term instate orfederal prison, as
distinguished from amisdemeanor
which isonlypunishable byconfine-
ment tocounty orlocal jailand/or a
fine. 2)acrime carrying aminimum
term ofoneyear ormore instate
prison, since ayear orlesscanbe
served incounty jail.However, a
sentence upon conviction fora
felonymaysometimes belessthan
oneyear atthediscretion ofthe
judge andwithin limits setby
statute. Felonies aresometimes re-
ferred toas“high crimes” asde-
scribed intheU.S. Constitution.
(See:misdemeanor, sentence)
felony murder doctrine: n.arule
ofcriminal statutes thatanydeathwhich occurs during thecommission
ofafelony isfirst degree murder,
and allparticipants inthatfelony or
attempted felony canbecharged
withandfound guilty ofmurder. A
typical example isarobbery involv-
ingmorethanonecriminal, inwhich
oneofthem shoots, beats todeath or
runs overastore clerk, killing the
clerk. Even ifthedeath were acci-
dental, alloftheparticipants canbe
found guilty offelony murder, in-
cluding thosewhodidnoharm, had
nogun,and/or didnotintend tohurt
anyone. Inabizarre situation, ifone
oftheholdup men orwomen is
killed, his/her fellow robbers canbe
charged withmurder. (See:murder)
fertile octogenarian: n.anunrealistic
notion thatanyperson (male orfe-
male) iscapable ofhaving achild no
matter atwhat age,infirmity orphys-
icaldeficiency. Thus, ifproperty title
could notpass toone’s child aslongas
heorshemight have oracquire asib-
ling, then he/she must wait until
mother anddadhave actually died,
unnecessarily tyinguptheproperty.
Most states have passed laws tocure
thisanomaly.
fictitious defendants: n.when aparty
suing (plaintiff) isnotsure ifhe/she
knows ifthere areunknown persons
involved intheincident orthebusi-
nessbeing sued, there arenamed ficti-
tious persons, usually designated Doe
I,Doe II,andsoforth, or“Green and
RedCompany,” withanallegation in
thecomplaint that ifandwhen the
truenames arediscovered they willbe
inserted inthecomplaint byamend-
ment. Naming fictitious defendants
stops thestatute oflimitations (the
time inwhich aparty has tofilea
172

fighting words
lawsuit) from running outeven
though thetruename isnotyet
known. Sometimes during theinves-
tigation ordiscovery (taking deposi-
tions orasking written questions
under oath)newinformation about a
potential defendant isfound andthe
realname substituted. Then that
person isserved with asummons
andcomplaint. Ifnosubstitution ofa
realname foraDoehasbeenmade
bythetime oftrial, usually the ficti-
tious defendants arethendismissed
from thecase since theynever exist-
edinthe first place, andthecase
continues against thenamed defen-
dants. Fictitious defendants arenot
permitted infederal cases.
Death and taxes are in-
evitable, butdeath doesnot

butfiduciaries caninclude business
advisers, attorneys, guardians, ad-
ministrators ofestates, real estate
agents, bankers, stockbrokers, title
companies oranyone who under-

istically, thefiduciary hasgreater
knowledge andexpertise about the
matters being handled. Afiduciaiyisheld toastandard ofconduct and
trust above that ofastranger orofa
casual business person. He/she/it
must avoid “self-dealing” or“conflicts
ofinterests” inwhich thepotential
benefit tothefiduciary isinconflict
withwhat isbest fortheperson who
trusts him/her/it. Forexample, a
stockbroker must consider thebest in-

him/her the highest commission.
While afiduciary andthebeneficiary
may jointogether inabusiness ven-

formation found later which would
change matters (such asrecurrence of
aproblem withaninjury), mutual re-
lease ofanyfurther claim byeach
party, astatement thatneither side is
admitting fault, andsome action or
payment byoneorboth sides. In
short, thecase isover, provided the
parties dowhat they aresupposed to
doaccording tothefinal settlement’s
terms. With theglutofcases crowding
court calendars andoverwhelming the
system anddelays ingetting totrial
(due tothree factors: increased crimi-
nalcase load, increased litigious na-
ture ofsociety andaninsufficient
number ofjudges), judges encourage
attempts tosettle, including mandato-

felonies such asrape, burglary,
arson, orinvolving multiple deaths,
thekilling ofcertain types ofpeople

prison guard, afellow prisoner), or
certain weapons, particularly a
gun.The specific criteria forfirst
degree murder, areestablished by
statute ineach state andbythe
U.S.Code infederal prosecutions.
Itisdistinguished from second de-
greemurder inwhich premedita-
tion isusually absent, andfrom
manslaughter, which lackspremed-
itation andsuggests that atmost
there was intent toharm rather
than tokill. (See:felony murder

legal issuewhich hasnever been de-
cided byanappeals court and, there-
fore, there isnoprecedent forthe
court tofollow. Toreach adecision
thecourt must use itsown logic,
analogies from prior rulings byap-

foreclosure: n.thesystem bywhich
apartywhohasloaned money se-
cured byamortgage ordeed of
trust onrealproperty (orhasan
unpaid judgment), requires saleof
thereal property torecover the
money due,unpaid interest, plus
thecosts offoreclosure, when the
debtor fails tomake payment. After
thepayments onthepromissory
note(which isevidence oftheloan)
havebecome delinquent forseveral
months (time varies from state to
state), thelender canhaveanotice
ofdefault served onthedebtor (bor-
rower) stating theamount dueand
theamount necessary to“cure” the
default. Ifthedelinquency and
costs offoreclosure arenotpaidwithin aspecified period, then the
lender (orthetrustee instates using
deeds oftrust) will setaforeclosure
date, afterwhich theproperty maybe
soldatpublic sale.Uptothetime of
foreclosure (oreven afterwards in
some states) thedefaulting borrower
canpay alldelinquencies and costs
(which arethen greater duetofore-
closure costs) and“redeem” theprop-
erty.Upon sale oftheproperty the
amount due ispaid tothecreditor
(lender orowner ofthejudgment)
andtheremainder ofthemoney re-
ceived from thesale, ifany, ispaid to
thelender. There isalsojudicial fore-
closure inwhich thelender canbring
suit forforeclosure against thede-
faulting borrower forthedelinquency
andforce asale.This isused insev-
eralstates with themortgage system
orindeed oftrust states when itap-
pears thattheamount due isgreater
than theequity value ofthereal
property, andthelender wishes toget
adeficiency judgment fortheamount
stilldueafter sale.This isnotneces-
sary inthose states which give defi-
ciency judgments without filing a
lawsuit when theforeclosure isupon
themortgage ordeed oftrust. (See:
deed oftrust, execution, forced
sale,mortgage, notice ofdefault)
foreclosure sale: n.theactual forced

fraud: n.theintentional useofdeceit, a
trick orsome dishonest means tode-
prive another ofhis/her/its money,
property oralegal right.Apartywho
haslostsomething duetofraud isen-
titled tofilealawsuit fordamages
against theparty acting fraudulently,
andthedamages mayinclude punitive
damages asapunishment orpublic ex-
ample duetothemalicious nature of
thefraud. Quite often there aresever-
alpersons involved inascheme to
commit fraudandeachand allmaybe
liable forthetotaldamages. Inherent
infraud isanunjust advantage over
another which injures thatperson or
entity. Itincludes failing topoint outa

fraud intheinducement
being purchased andnot20as
originally understood. Constructive
fraud canbeproved byashowing
ofbreach oflegal duty (likeusing
thetrust funds held foranother in
aninvestment inone’sown busi-
ness) without direct proof offraud
orfraudulent intent. Extrinsic
fraud occurs when deceit isem-
ployed tokeepsomeone from exer-
cising aright, such asafair trial,
byhiding evidence ormisleading
theopposing party inalawsuit.
Since fraud isintended toemploy
dishonesty todeprive another of
money, property oraright, itcan
alsobeacrime forwhich thefraud-
ulent person(s) canbecharged,
triedandconvicted. Borderline
overreaching ortaking advantage
ofanother’s naivetd involving
smaller amounts isoften over-
looked bylawenforcement, which
suggests thevictim seek a“civil
remedy” (i.e., sue). However, in-
creasingly fraud, which has vic-
timized alarge segment ofthe
public (even inindividually small
amounts), hasbecome thetarget
ofconsumer fraud divisions inthe
offices ofdistrict attorneys and
attorneys general. (See:construc-
tivefraud, exemplary damages,
extrinsic fraud, fraud inthe
inducement, fraudulent con-
veyance, intrinsic fraud)
fraud intheinducement: n.theuse
ofdeceit ortrick tocause someone to
acttohis/her disadvantage, such as
signing anagreement ordeeding
away realproperty. Theheart ofthis
typeoffraud ismisleading theother
party astothefactsupon which
he/she willbase his/her decision
toact.Example: “there willbetaxadvantages toyou ifyou letme
take title toyour property,” or“you
don’t have toread therest ofthe

language” butactually includes a
balloon payment. (See: extrinsic
fraud, fraud)
fraudulent conveyance: n.the
transfer (conveyance) oftitle toreal
property fortheexpress purpose of
putting itbeyond thereach ofa
known creditor. Insuch acase the
creditor maybring alawsuit tovoid
thetransfer. However, ifthetrans-
ferwasmade without knowledge of
theclaim (orbefore adebt has
matured), forother legitimate rea-
sons, and/or inthenormal course of
business, then thecreditor’s attempt
toobtain ajudgment setting aside
theconveyance willprobably fail.
freeand clear: adj.referring tothe
ownership ofrealproperty uponwhich
there isnolien,encumbrance, record-
edjudgment ortheright ofanyone to
make aclaim against theproperty.
Theterm isused incontracts forsale

freeonboard (FOB): adj.referring to
purchased goods shipped without

maker inDetroit sellsacar“FOB
Detroit,” then there willbeaship-
pingcharge ifdelivery istaken any-
where else. Ifthecontract reads
“FOBNew Orleans,” then theauto
willbeshipped tothat citywithout
charge, butwithcharge fordelivery
fromNew Orleans tosomewhere
else. (See:FOB)
fresh pursuit: n.immediate chase
ofasuspected criminal byalaw
enforcement officer, inwhich situ-
ation the officer may arrest the
suspect without awarrant. Itcan
also refer tochasing asuspect or
escaped felon intoaneighboring
jurisdiction inanemergency, as
distinguished from entering anoth-
erjurisdiction with time toalert
lawenforcement people inthat
area. Example: when adeputy
sheriff fromMontgomery County
pursues acardriven byasuspect-
edbank robber into Baltimore
County (inwhich henormally has
nopower toenforce thelaw), the
doctrine offresh pursuit allows
him/her tomake thearrest. Itis
also called hotpursuit. (See:hot
pursuit)
friendly suit: n.alawsuit filed in
order toobtain acourt orderwhen
theparties tothesuitagree onthe
expected outcome. Such alegal ac-
tion willbedismissed ifitisanat-
tempt togetanadvisory opinion, is
collusive (deceitfully planned) toget
ajudgment tosetalegal precedent
orwhere there isnorealcontrover-
sy.However, such suits areallowed
insituations inwhich thestatutes
require acourt ruling toachieve a
“reasonable result,” such asreform-ing(correcting) atrust oragreement
inwhich therewasanerror.
frisk: v.quickly patting down the
clothes ofapossible criminal suspect
todetermine ifthere isaconcealed
weapon. This police action isgen-
erally considered legal (constitution-

frivolous: adj. referring toalegal
move inalawsuit clearly intended
merely toharass, delay orembarrass
theopposition. Frivolous actscanin-
clude filing thelawsuit itself, abase-
lessmotion foralegal ruling, anan-
swer ofadefendant toacomplaint
which doesnotdeny, contest, prove
orcontrovert anything, oranappeal
which contains notasingle arguable
basis (byanystretch oftheimagina-
tion) fortheappeal. Afrivolous law-
suit,motion orappeal canresult ina
successful claim bytheother party
forpayment bythefrivolous suer of
their attorneys’ fees fordefending
thecase.Judges arereluctant tofind
anaction frivolous, based onthede-
sirenottodiscourage people from
using thecourts toresolve disputes.
fruit ofthepoisonous tree: n.in
criminal law, thedoctrine that evi-
dence discovered due toinformation
found through illegal search orother
unconstitutional means (such asa
forced confession) may notbeintro-
duced byaprosecutor. Thetheory is
thatthetree(original illegal evidence)
ispoisoned andthus taints what
grows from it.Forexample, aspartof
acoerced admission made without
giving aprime suspect theso-called

frustration ofpurpose
“Miranda warnings” (statement of
rights, including theright toremain
silent andwhat he/she says willbe
usedagainst them), thesuspect tells
the police thelocation ofstolen

ty.(See:Miranda warning)
frustration ofpurpose: n.some-
times called commercial frustration,
when unexpected events arise
whichmake acontract impossible to
beperformed, entitling thefrustrat-
edparty torescind thecontract
without paying damages. Example:
Jack Appleseller contracts tobuya
commercial building torent out,
and,while thesale ispending, the
building iscondemned bythecityas
unsafe foranyuse.Mr.Appleseller
canbackoutofthepurchase with-
outobligation. (See:commercial

any fugitives from justice tothe
statewhere they allegedly commit-
tedthecrime, aprocess called ex-
tradition. (See: extradition)
fungible things: n.sometimes
merely called “fungibles,” goods
which areinterchangeable, often
soldordelivered inbulk, sinceany
oneofthem isasgood asanother.
Grain orgravel arefungibles, as
aresecurities which areidentical.fullfaithandcredit: n.theprovision
inArticle IV,Section 1oftheU.S.
Constitution which states: “Full
faithand credit shall begiven in
each State tothepublic acts, records
and judicial proceedings ofevery
other state.” Thus, ajudgment ina
lawsuit oracriminal conviction ren-
dered inone state shall berecog-
nized and enforced inanyother
state, solong astheoriginal judg-
mentwasreached bydueprocess of
law.Each statehasaprocess forob-
taining anenforceable judgment
based ona“foreign” (out-of-state)
judgment.
fulldisclosure: n.theneed inbusi-
ness transactions totellthe“whole
truth” about anymatter which the

cealing any significant fact. (See:
caveat emptor)
future interest: n.aright toreceive
either real property orpersonal
property some time inthefuture, ei-
therupon aparticular date orupon
theoccurrence ofanevent. Typical
examples aregetting titleupon the

gagorder: n.ajudge’s order pro-
hibiting theattorneys andthepar-
tiestoapending lawsuit orcriminal
prosecution from talking tothe
media orthepublic about thecase.
Thesupposed intent istoprevent
prejudice duetopre-trial publicity
which would influence potential ju-
rors.Agagorder hasthesecondary
purpose ofpreventing thelawyers
from trying thecase inthepress
andontelevision, andthus creating
apublic mood (which could getugly)
infavor ofoneparty ortheother.
Based onthe“freedom ofthepress”
provision oftheFirstAmendment,
thecourt cannot constitutionally re-
strict themedia from printing or
broadcasting information about the
case, sotheonlyway istoputagag
ontheparticipants under thecourt’s
control. InCanada, however, the
media canberestricted, asinafa-
mous case inwhich American news-
papers were smuggled across the
border toreport onaparticularly
lurid sex-murder case inwhich a
second accused person wasyettobe
tried.Agagorder canalsobemade
byanexecutive agency such as
when President George Bush issued
agagorder which forbade federally
funded health clinics from giving
outinformation about abortions, a
gagorder which President BillClin-
tonrescinded onhisfirstdayinof-
fice,January 22,1993.

generation skipping: adj., adv. re-
ferring togiftsmade through trusts
byagrandparent toagrandchild,
skipping one’s child (thegrandchild’s
parent). Originally intended toavoid
ordefer federal giftorestate taxes if
paidthrough a“generation skipping

gobail: v.slang forputting upthe
bailmoney togetanaccused defen-
dant outofjailafteranarrest or
pending trialorappeal.
good cause: n.alegally sufficient
reason foraruling orother action by
ajudge. Thelanguage iscommonly:
“There being goodcause shown, the
court orders...”
good faith: n.honest intent toact
without taking anunfair advan-
tageoveranother person ortoful-
fillapromise toact,evenwhen
some legal technicality isnotful-
filled. Theterm isapplied toall
kinds oftransactions.
goods: n.items held forsale inthe
regular course ofbusiness, asina
retail store.
Good Samaritan rule: n.fromaBib-
lical story, ifavolunteer comes tothe
aidofaninjured orillperson who is
astranger, theperson giving theaid
owes thestranger aduty ofbeing
reasonably careful. Insome circum-
stances negligence could result ina
claim ofnegligent care iftheinjuries
orillness weremade worse bythe
volunteer’s negligence. Thus, ifJack
Goodguy seesaman lying bythe
road, avictim ofahitandrun acci-

against itandtherefore canbesold,
transferred orputupassecurity
(placing amortgage ordeed oftrust

goodwill: n.thebenefit ofabusiness
having agood reputation under its
name andregular patronage. Good-
will isnottangible likeequipment,
right tolease thepremises orinvento-
ryofgoods. Itbecomes important
when abusiness issold, since there
canbeanallocation inthesales price
forthevalue ofthegoodwill, which is
always asubjective estimate. Includ-
edingoodwill upon salemaybethe
right todobusiness without competi-
tionbytheseller intheareaand/or for
aspecified period oftime. Sellers like
theallocation togoodwill tobehigh
since itisnotsubject tocapital gains
tax,while buyers prefer ittobelow,
because itcannot bedepreciated for
taxpurposes like tangible assets.
Goodwill alsomaybeoverestimated
byaproud seller andbelieved byan
unknowing buyer. (See: sale)
governmental immunity: n.thedoc-
trinefromEnglish common lawthat
nogovernmental body canbesued
unless itgives permission. This pro-
tection resulted interrible injustices,
since public hospitals, government
drivers andother employees could be
negligent withimpunity (free) from
judgment. TheFederal TortClaims
Actand state waivers ofimmunity
(with specific claims systems) have
negated this rule, which stemmed
from thedayswhen kings set
186

Grand Jury
prerogatives. (See:Federal Tort
Claims Act,immunity)
grace period: n.atime stated ina
contract inwhich alatepayment
orperformance maybemade with-
outpenalty. Often after thegrace
period ends without payment or
performance bytheperson who is
supposed topay, thecontract is
suspended. Example: ifaperson
does notpay his/her insurance
payment (premium) bythestated
deadline, he/she usually hasafew
days extra topaybefore theab-
solute deadline. Iftheperson does
notpaybythen, theinsurance
company cancels thecontract, i.e.
your insurance.
grandfather clause: n.1)aclause
inastatute orzoning ordinance
(particularly acity ordinance)
which permits theoperator ofa
business oralandowner tobeex-
emptfrom restrictions onuse ifthe
business orproperty continues to
beused asitwaswhen thelawwas
adopted. Upon passage ofthe
statute orregulation, thespecific
property may bereferred toas
“grandfathered in.”Example: the
citypasses anordinance which
does notpermit retail businesses
inaparticular zone, butanyexist-
ingstore cancontinue tofunction
inthearea,evenwithnewowners.
However, ifthepremises stop
being aretail outlet then the
grandfather clause will lapse. 2)
among the state constitutional
amendments passed bysouthern
states inthe late1800s tokeep
blacks from voting, “grandfather
clauses” denied voter registration
topeople whowere illiterate, whodidnotown property orcould not
passatestoncitizenship obligations,
unless their grandfathers hadserved
intheConfederate Army. Such laws
arenowunconstitutional.
grandfathered in:adj.refers tocon-
tinued allowed useofproperty asit
waswhen restrictions orzoning ordi-
nances were adopted.
Grand Jury: n.ajury ineachcounty
orfederal court district which serves
foraterm ofayearand isusually se-
lected fromalistofnominees offered
bythejudges inthecounty ordis-
trict. The traditional 23members
may beappointed orhave their
names drawn from those nominated.
AGrand Jury hastworesponsibili-
ties: 1)tohear evidence ofcriminal
accusations inpossible felonies
(major crimes) presented bytheDis-
trictAttorney and decide whether
theaccused should beindicted and
tried foracrime. Sincemany felony
charges arefiledbytheDistrict At-
torney inamunicipal orother lower
court which holds apreliminary
hearing todetermine ifthere isjust
cause fortrialinstead ofhaving the
Grand Jury hear thematter, this
function isofminor importance in
many jurisdictions. 2)tohear evi-
dence ofpotential public wrong-
doing bycityandcounty officials, in-
cluding actswhich may notbe
crimes butareimprudent, ineffec-
tiveorinefficient, andmake recom-
mendations tothecounty and cities
involved. Example: aGrand Jury
mayrecommend thatanew jail is
needed, findthatthere isevidence of
favoritism inthesheriff’s office, that
some citycouncil members areprof-
itingbyoverlooking drug dealing by
187

citystaffers, orthatjudges arenot
carrying afullload ofcases tobe
tried. (See: charge, indictment,
preliminary hearing)
grand larceny: n.thecrime oftheft
ofanother’s property (including
money) overacertain value (forex-
ample, $500), asdistinguished from
petty (orpetit) larceny inwhich the
value isbelow thegrand larceny
limit. Some states only recognize
thecrime oflarceny, butdraw the
linebetween afelony (punishable by
state prison time) andamisde-
meanor (local jailand/or fine)based
onthevalue oftheloot. (See: larce-
ny,theft)
grand theft: n.(See:grand larceny)
grant: v.totransfer real property
fromatitleholder (grantor) orhold-
ers toanother (grantee) with or
without payment. However, there is
animportant difference between the
types ofdeeds used.Agrant deed
warrants (guarantees) that the
grantor (seller) has fullright and
title totheproperty, while aquit-
claim deedonlygrants whatever the
grantor owns (which maybenoth-
ing)andguarantees nothing. (See:
grant deed, grantee, grantor,
quitclaim deed)
grant deed: n.thedocument which
transfers title torealproperty ora
real property interest from one
party (grantor) toanother
(grantee). Itmust describe the
property bylegal description of
boundaries and/or parcel numbers,
besigned byallpeople transfer-
ringtheproperty, andbeacknowl-
edged before anotary public. Thetransfer isfinalized byrecording
with theCounty Recorder or
Recorder ofDeeds. Importantly, a
grant deed warrants that the
grantor actually owned the title to
transfer, which aquitclaim deed
would not, since itonly transfers
what thegrantor owned, ifanything.
(See: grant, grantee, grantor,
quitclaim deed)
grantee: n.thepartywhoreceives title
toreal property (buyer, recipient,
donee) from theseller (grantor) bya
document called agrant deed orquit-
claim deed. (See:grant)
grantor: n.thepartywhotransfers title
inrealproperty (seller, giver) toanoth-
er(buyer, recipient, donee) bygrant
deed orquitclaim deed. (See:grant)
grantor-grantee index: n.asetof
books and/or computerized listsfound
intheoffice ofevery County Recorder
orRecorder ofDeeds which lists all
recorded transfers oftitlebydeed (as
wellasliens, mortgages, deeds oftrust
andother documents affecting title).
Each yearly index isusually alphabet-
izedbythelastnames ofgrantors (the
party transferring title)andgrantee
(therecipients oftitle).The listing in-
cludes thedateoftransfer, andcross-
references tothebookandpage ordoc-
ument number where acopy ofthe
document (often onmicrofilm) was
recorded andcanbeexamined. This is
akeyinstrument intracking achain
oftitle.
gratuitous: adj. oradv. voluntary

gravamen: n.Latin for“toweigh

ample: inanaccident case, the
gravamen maybethenegligence of
thedefendant, and inacontract
case, itmaybethebreach ofthede-
fendant. (See: cause ofaction,
charge, complaint)
gross negligence: n.carelessness
which isinreckless disregard for
thesafety orlives ofothers, and is
sogreat itappears tobeaconscious
violation ofother people’s rights to
safety. Itismore than simple inad-
vertence, but itisjustshyofbeing
intentionally evil. Ifonehas bor-
rowed orcontracted totake care of
another’s property, then gross negli-
gence isthefailure toactively take
thecareonewould ofhis/her own
property. Ifgross negligence is
found bythetrier offact(judge or

punitive damages ontopofgeneral
and special damages. (See:dam-
ages,exemplary damages, negli-
gence, punitive damages)
gross income: n.incalculating in-
come tax,theincome ofanindivid-
ualorbusiness from allsources be-

which will result innetincome.
(See:income tax)
guarantee: 1)v.topledge oragree to
beresponsible foranother’s debt or
contractual performance ifthat
other person does notpayorper-
form. Usually, theparty receiving
theguarantee will firsttrytocollect
orobtain performance from the
debtor before trying tocollect from
theonemaking theguarantee (guar-
antor). 2)thepromise topaymother’s debt orfulfill contract oblig-
ations ifthatparty fails topayorper-

iftheother fails topayorperform.
(See:guarantee)
guaranty: v.and n.anolder spelling
ofguarantee, which therenowned
Oxford etymologist Dr.Walter Skeat
called a“better spelling” (1882).
(See:guarantee)
guardian: n.aperson whohasbeen ap-
pointed byajudge totake care ofa
minor child orincompetent adult (both
called “ward”) personally and/or man-
agethat person’s affairs. Tbbecome a
guardian ofachild either theparty in-
tending tobetheguardian oranother
family member, aclose friend oralocal
official responsible foraminor’s wel-
fare willpetition thecourt toappoint
theguardian. Inthecase ofaminor,
theguardianship remains under court
supervision untilthechild reaches ma-
jority at18.Naming someone inawill
asguardian ofone’s child incaseofthe
death oftheparent ismerely anomi-
nation. Thejudge does nothave to
honor that request, although he/she
usually does. Sadly, often aparent
must petition tobecome theguardian
ofhis/her child’s “estate” ifthechild in-
herits orreceives agiftofsubstantial
assets, including the situation in
which aparent gives his/her ownchild
aninterest inrealproperty orstocks.
Therefore, thattype ofgiftshould be
avoided andatrust created instead.

guardian adlitem
While theterm “guardian” may
refer tosomeone who isappointed
tocare forand/or handle the af-
fairs ofaperson who isincompe-
tentorincapable ofadministering
his/her affairs, this ismore often
called a“conservator” under acon-
servatorship. (See: conservator,
ward)
guardian adlitem: n.aperson ap-
pointed bythecourt only totake
legal action onbehalf ofaminor or
anadult notable tohandle his/her
own affairs. Duties mayinclude fil-
ingalawsuit foraninjured child,
defending alawsuit orfiling a
claim against anestate. Usually a
parent will fileapetition tobeap-
pointed theguardian adlitem ofa
child hurt inanaccident atthe
same time thelawsuit isfiled.
(See:adlitem)
guest: n.1)ingeneral, aperson pay-
ingtostay inahotel, motel orinn
forashort time. 2)aperson stay-
ingatanother’s residence without
charge, called a“social guest.” An
important distinction isthat a
non-paying guest isnotowed the
duty ofbeing provided asafe
boarding space, asisapaying cus-
tomer. Thus ifasocial guest trips
onaslippery rug, he/she hasno
right tosuefornegligence, buta
paying guest might. 3)an“automo-
bile”guest isonewho isapassen-
gerwithout paying, asdistin-
guished from ataxi fare,busrider
oronewhohaspaid afriend to
drive. However, the so-called
“guest statute” may give anon-
paying passenger theright tosue.
Anautomobile guest issomewhat
(butnotentirely) analogous tothe“social guest” inaresidence. (See:
guest statute, invitee)
guest statute: n.astate lawwhich
setsstandards ofcarebythedriver
ofacartoanon-paying passenger.
Although state laws vary, thebasic
concept isthatthesocial passenger
canbring suit fornegligence against
thedriver forgross negligence only if
thedriver could have foreseen that
his/her actions orcarcould putthe
rider ingreat peril. Examples: dri-
vingwhile drunk, going faroverthe
speed limit, playing “chicken,” tak-
ingchances, driving acarknowing
thebrakes arefaulty, orparticularly
continuing thereckless driving after
thepassenger hasasked thedriver
tostop orasked tobeletout. (See:
guest)
guilty: adj.having been convicted ofa
crime orhaving admitted thecom-
mission ofacrime bypleading
“guilty” (saying youdid it).Adefen-
dantmay alsobefound guilty bya
judge after apleaof“nocontest,” or
inLatin nolo contendere. Theterm
“guilty” isalsosometimes applied to
persons against whom ajudgment
hasbeenfound inalawsuit foracivil
wrong, such asnegligence orsome
intentional actlikeassault orfraud,
butthat isaconfusing misuse ofthe
word since itshould onlyapply toa
criminal charge. (See:admission of
guilt, copaplea, pleabargain)

habeas corpus :(hay-bee-us core-
puss) n.Latin for“youhave the
body,” itisawrit(court order) which
directs thelawenforcement officials
(prison administrators, police or
sheriff) whohave custody ofapris-
oner toappear incourt with the
prisoner tohelpthejudge determine
whether theprisoner islawfully in
prison orjail.Thewrit isobtained
bypetition toajudge inthecounty
ordistrict where theprisoner isin-
carcerated, and thejudge setsa
hearing onwhether there isalegal
basis forholding the prisoner.
Habeas corpus isaprotection
against illegal confinement, such as
holding aperson without charges,
when due process obviously has
been denied, bail isexcessive, parole
hasbeen granted, anaccused has
beenimproperly surrendered bythe
bailbondsman orprobation has
been summarily terminated with-
outcause. Historically called “the
great writ,” therenowned scholar of
theCommon Law, William Black-
stone, called itthe“most celebrated
writ inEnglish law.” Itmay alsobe
used asameans tocontest child
custody and deportation proceed-
ingsincourt.Thewritofhabeas cor-
puscanbeemployed procedurally in
federal district courts tochallenge
theconstitutionality ofastate court
conviction.
habitable: adj.referring toaresi-
dence that issafeandcanbeoccu-
pied inreasonable comfort.
Although standards varybyregion,
thepremises should beclosedinagainst theweather, provide run-
ning water, access todecent toilets
andbathing facilities, heating, and
electricity. Particularly inmulti-
dwelling buildings freedom from nox-
ioussmells, noiseandgarbage arein-
cluded inthestandard. Thiscanbe-
come important inlandlord-tenant
disputes orgovernment actions to
force alandlord tomake thepremis-
eslivable (abatement ofdeficiencies).
Example: iftheroofbegins toleak,
thewater goes off,the electricity
shorts outorthe toilet breaks, in
most states thelandlord hasaduty
tomake repairs when requested or
thetenant mayorder therepairs and
deduct thecostfrom therent. (See:

While technically atrial with a
judge sitting without ajury fitsthe
definition, ahearing usually refers
tobrief sessions involving aspecif-
icquestion atsome time prior to
thetrial itself, orsuch specialized
proceedings asadministrative
hearings. Incriminal law,a“pre-

ment isremoval from office. One
President, Andrew Johnson in1868,
wascharged with violation offed-
erallaws inapolitically motivated
impeachment, butwas acquitted
bythemargin ofonevote ina
trialheldbytheSenate. President
Richard Nixon resigned in1974
rather than faceimpending im-
peachment charges brought bythe
House ofRepresentatives intheWa-
tergate affair, inwhich hewas ac-
cused ofobstructing theinvestiga-
tionandlying toCongress about his
participation. Several federal judges
havebeenimpeached andninehave

impeachment: n.1)discrediting awitness byshowing thathe/she isnot
telling thetruth ordoesnothave the
knowledge totestify ashe/she did.

impleader: n.aprocedural device be-
fore trial inwhich aparty brings a
third party intothelawsuit because

implied: adj., adv.referring tocircum-
stances, conduct orstatements ofone
orboth parties which substitute for
explicit language toprove authority to
act,warranty, promise, trust, agree-
ment, consent oreasement, among
other things. Thus circumstances
“imply” something rather than spell it
out. (See: consideration, contract,
covenant, easement, implied con-
sent,implied warranty)
implied consent: n.consent when sur-
rounding circumstances exist which
would leadareasonable person tobe-
lievethat thisconsent hadbeen given,
although nodirect, express orexplicit
words ofagreement hadbeen uttered.
Examples: a)a“contract” based onthe
factthatoneperson hasbeen doing a
particular thingandtheother person
expects him/her tocontinue; b)thede-
fense ina“date rape” case inwhich

“maybe” or“later.” (See:implied)
implied contract: n.anagreement
which isfound toexist based on
thecircumstances when todeny a
contract would beunfair and/or re-
sultinunjust enrichment tooneof
theparties. Animplied contract is
distinguished from an“express
contract.” (See:contract, express
contract, implied)
implied covenant ofgood faith
and fairdealing: n.ageneral as-
sumption ofthelawofcontracts, that
people willactingood faithanddeal
fairly without breaking their word,
using shifty means toavoid obliga-
tions ordenying what theother
party obviously understood. Alaw-
suit(oroneofthecauses ofaction in
alawsuit) based onthebreach ofthis
covenant isoften brought when the
other party hasbeen claiming tech-
nical excuses forbreaching thecon-
tract orusing thespecific words of
thecontract torefuse toperform
when thesurrounding circum-
stances orapparent understanding
oftheparties were tothecontrary.
Example: anemployer fires along-
time employee without cause and
says itcan fireatwhim because the
employment contract states theem-
ployment is“atwill.” However, the
employee wasencouraged tojointhe
company onthebasis ofretirement
plans andother conduct which led
him/her tobelieve thejobwas per-
manent barring misconduct orfinan-
cialdownturn. Thus, there could bea
breach oftheimplied covenant, since
thesurrounding circumstances im-
plied thatthere would becareer-long
employment. (See:implied)implied warranty: n.anassumption
atlaw that products are“mer-
chantable,” meaning theywork and
areuseable asnormally expected by
consumers, unless there isawarning
thatthey aresold “asis”orsecond-
hand without anywarranty. Agrant
deed ofrealproperty carries theim-
pliedwarranty ofgood title,meaning
thegrantor (seller) hadatitle(own-
ership) totransfer. (See: caveat
emptor, implied)
impossibility: n.when anactcannot
beperformed duetonature, physical
impediments orunforeseen events.
Itcanbealegitimate basis torescind

forannulment ofamarriage ifthe
condition existed atthetime ofthe
marriage andgrounds fordivorce

with sterility, which means inability
toproduce children.
impound: v.1)tocollect funds, inad-
dition toinstallment payments, from
aperson whoowes adebtsecured by
property, andplacethem inaspecial
account topayproperty taxesandin-
surance when due.This protects the
lender orseller from theborrower’s
possible failure tokeepuptheinsur-
ance oramounting tax billwhich is

away records, money orproperty,
such asanautomobile orbuilding, by
government action pending theout-
come ofacriminal prosecution. The

cial liability) foractsorinjuries to
another, because ofaparticular re-
lationship, suchasmother tochild,

inabsentia-, (inab-sensh-ee-ah) adj.
oradv. phrase. Latin for“inab-
sence,” ormore fully, inone’s ab-
sence. Occasionally acriminal trial
isconducted without thedefendant
being present when he/she walksoutorescapes after the trial has
begun, since theaccused hasthus
waived theconstitutional right toface

states, even ifconsensual byboth

exact nature oftheindependent con-
tractor’s relationship with theparty
hiring him/her/it hasbecome vital
since anindependent contractor
pays his/her/its own Social Security,
income taxes without payroll deduc-
tion, hasnoretirement orhealth
plan rights, andoften isnotentitled
toworker’s compensation coverage.
Public agencies, particularly theIn-
ternal Revenue Service, lookhard at
independent contractor agreements
when itappears thecontractor is
much likeanemployee. Anindepen-

indorsement
indictable offense: n.acrime (of-
fense) forwhich aGrand Jury rules
that there isenough evidence to
charge adefendant withafelony (a
crime punishable bydeath ora
term inthestate penitentiary).
These crimes include murder,
manslaughter, rape, kidnapping,
grand theft, robbery, burglary,
arson, conspiracy, fraud andother
major crimes, aswellasattempts to
commit them. (See:indictment)
indictment: n.acharge ofafelony
(serious crime) voted byaGrand
Jurybasedupon aproposed charge,
witnesses’ testimony andother evi-
dence presented bythepublic pros-
ecutor (District Attorney). Tobring
anindictment theGrand Jury will
notfind guilt, butonlytheprobabil-
itythat acrime wascommitted,
thattheaccused person did itand
thathe/she should betried. District
Attorneys often onlyintroduce key
facts sufficient toshow theproba-
bility, both tosavetimeandtoavoid
revealing alltheevidence. The
FifthAmendment totheU.S.Con-
stitution provides that“Noperson
shallbeheld toanswer foracapital,
orotherwise infamous crime, un-
lessonpresentment ofaGrand
Jury....” However, while grand ju-
riesarecommon incharging feder-
alcrimes, many states usegrand
juries sparingly andusethecrimi-
nalcomplaint, followed bya“pre-
liminary hearing” heldbyalower
court judge orother magistrate,
who willdetermine whether ornot
theprosecutor haspresented suffi-
cient evidence thattheaccused has
committed afelony. Ifthejudge
finds there isenough evidence,
he/she willorder thecase sent totheappropriate court fortrial. (See:
felony, Grand Jury, indictable of-

indigent: 1)n.aperson sopoorand
needy thathe/she cannot provide the
necessities oflife(food, clothing, de-
cent shelter) forhimself/herself. 2)n.
onewithout sufficient income toaf-
fordalawyer fordefense inacrimi-
nalcase. Ifthecourt finds aperson is
anindigent, thecourtmust appoint
apublic defender orother attorney
torepresent him/her. This constitu-
tional right ofcounsel fortheindi-
gentwasdetermined byGideon v.
Wainright in1963,when apenciled

tention ofprominent Washington at-
torney AbeFortas, who carried the
case totheSupreme Court forfree.
Fortas later became anAssociate
Justice oftheSupreme Court. 3)adj.
referring toaperson who isvery
poorandneedy.
indispensable party: n.aperson or
entity which must beincluded ina
lawsuit sothatthecourt canmake a
finaljudgment ororder that willcon-
clude thecontroversy. Example: Ned
Neighbor brings anaction toenforce
hisclaimed right tocross theproper-
tyofOliver andOlivia Owner, but
onlynames Oliver asadefendant. To
make itpossible forthecourt to
order theproperty owners tohonor
Ned’s easement, Olivia asaco-owner
isanindispensable party. Theproce-
dural solution isforNeighbor to
amend hiscomplaint orpetition to
joinOlivia asadefendant.

most often found indivorces by
young marrieds orpoordefendants
whohavebeen sued.
information: n.anaccusation orcriminal charge brought bythepublic
prosecutor (District Attorney) without
aGrand Jury indictment. This “infor-
mation” must state thealleged crimes
inwriting andmust bedelivered to
thedefendant atthe first court ap-
pearance (arraignment). Iftheaccusa-
tion isforafelony, there must bea
preliminary hearing within ashort
period (such asfivedays) inwhich the
prosecution isrequired topresent
enough evidence toconvince thejudge
holding thehearing thatthecrime or
crimes charged were committed and
thedefendant islikely tohave com-
mitted them. Ifthejudge becomes
convinced, thedefendant must face
trial,and ifthejudge does not,the
case against thedefendant isdis-
missed. Sometimes itisamixed bag,
inthatsome ofthecharges inthein-
formation aresufficient fortrialand
thecase issent(remanded) totheap-
propriate court, andsome are dis-
missed. (See: accusation, charge,
felony, Grand Jury, indictment,

information and belief: n.aphrase
often used inlegal pleadings (com-
plaints andanswers inalawsuit), de-
clarations under penalty ofperjury,
and affidavits under oath, inwhich
theperson making thestatement or
allegation qualifies it.Ineffect, he/she
says: “Iamonly stating what Ihave
been told,and Ibelieve it.”This
makes clear about which statements
he/she doesnothave sure-fire, person-
alknowledge (perhaps itisjust
hearsay orsurmise) andprotects the
maker ofthestatement fromclaims of
outright falsehood orperjury. Thetyp-
icalphraseology is:“Plaintiff isin-
formed and believes, andupon such
information and belief, alleges that
208

inherit
defendant diverted thefunds tohis
own use.” (See: affidavit, answer,
complaint, declaration, perjury)
informed consent: n.agreement to
dosomething ortoallow something
tohappen only after alltherelevant
facts areknown. Incontracts, an
agreement may bereached only if
there hasbeen fulldisclosure by
both parties ofeverything each
partyknows which issignificant to
theagreement. Apatient’s consent
toamedical procedure must be
based onhis/her having been told
allthepossible consequences, ex-
cept inemergency caseswhen such
consent cannot beobtained. Aphysi-
cianordentist whodoesnot tellall
thepossible badnews aswellasthe
good, operates athis/her peril ofa
lawsuit ifanything goeswrong. In
criminal law,aperson accused or
even suspected ofacrime cannot
giveuphis/her legal rights such as
remaining silent orhaving anattor-
ney,unless he/she hasbeen fully in-
formed ofhis/her rights. (See:con-
sent,Miranda warning)
infra :prep. Latin for“below,” this is
legalshorthand toindicate thatthe

without permission, without notice,
andespecially without contracting for

inherit: v.toreceive alloraportion of
the estate ofanancestor upon
his/her death, usually from aparent

injunction: n.awrit (order) issued
byacourt ordering someone todo
something orprohibiting some act
after acourt hearing. The proce-
dure isforsomeone whohasbeen
orisindanger ofbeing harmed, or
needs some help (relief) orhis/her
attorney, toa)petition forthein-
junction toprotect his/her rights; to
b)getan“order toshow cause”

cause onthepartywhom he/she
wishes tohave ordered toactorbe
restrained (“enjoined”); partake in
ahearing inwhich both sides at-
tempt toconvince thejudge why
theinjunction should orshould not
begranted. Ifthere isdanger ofim-
mediate irreparable harm atthe
time thepetition isfiled, ajudge
may issue atemporary injunction
which goes into effectupon itbeing
served (deliver orhave delivered)
totheother party. Thistemporary
injunction willstay inforce until
thehearing orsometimes until the
outcome ofalawsuit isdecided inwhich aninjunction isone ofthe
parts ofthe plaintiff’s demands (in
the“prayer”). Afinalandcontinuing
injunction iscalled apermanent in-
junction. Examples ofinjunctions in-
clude prohibitions against cutting
trees, creating nuisances, polluting a
stream, picketing which goesbeyond
thebounds offreespeech andassem-
bly,orremoving funds from abank
account pending determination of
ownership. So-called “mandatory” in-
junctions which require acts tobe
performed, may include return of
property, keeping agate toaroadun-

byboth sides inahearing rather than
inafull-scale trial, although some-
times itispart ofalawsuit fordam-
ages and/or contract performance.
Historically, thepower togrant in-

inkind: adj.referring topayment,
distribution orsubstitution of
things inlieuofmoney, acombina-
tionofgoods andmoney, ormoney
instead ofanarticle. Itisanex-
pression often found inwillsand
trusts, which empowers theexecu-
torortrustee tomake distribution
tobeneficiaries “inkind” according
tohis/her discretion aslongasthe
value isequivalent tothevalue in-
tended tobegiven toeach benefi-
ciary. This isimportant since ital-
lows distribution offurniture, heir-
looms, stocks andbonds, automo-
biles oreven realproperty (aswell
asmoney) among thebeneficiaries
without selling assets togetcash.
Example: Edward Doright dies

ason.Hehasahouse worth
$150,000, cash of$100,000, art
works valued at$50,000, twocars
at$10,000 each, $150,000 instocks,
andjewelry appraised at$25,000.
Since thetotal value is$495,000,
theexecutor canthus divide thisup
bygiving each child things and
money valued at$165,000. Theone
taking thehouse would then geta
carand$5,000 cash, etc.Inthis
way giftscanbedistributed most
appropriately totheneeds oftherecipients. The “inkind” provision
mayavoid thepotential lowvalue re-
turns from estate salesandthecostof
realestate commissions. (See: distri-
bution, trust, will)
inlieu: prep, instead. “Inlieutaxes”

inperpetuity: adj. forever, asin
one’s right tokeep theprofits from
theland inperpetuity.inpersonam: adj. (inpurr-soh-nam)
from Latin for“directed toward apar-
ticular person.” Inalawsuit inwhich
thecase isagainst aspecific individ-
ual,thatperson must beserved witha
summons andcomplaint togive the
court jurisdiction totrythecase,and
thejudgment applies tothatperson
and iscalled an“inpersonam judg-
ment.” Inpersonam isdistinguished
from inrem,which applies toproperty
or“alltheworld” instead ofaspecific
person. This technical distinction is
important todetermine where tofilea
lawsuit andhow toserve adefendant.
Inpersonam means thatajudgment
canbeenforceable against theperson
wherever he/she is.Ontheother
hand, ifthelawsuit istodetermine
title toproperty (inrem)then theac-
tionmust befiledwhere theproperty
exists and isonly enforceable there.
(See: inrem,jurisdiction)
inproper :adj.short forinpropria per-
sona. (See: inpropria persona )
inpropria persona: adj.from Latin
“for one’s self,” acting onone’sown
behalf, generally used toidentify a
person who isacting ashis/her own
attorney inalawsuit. Thepopular
abbreviation is“inproper.” Inthe
filed legaldocuments (pleadings), the
party’s name, address andtelephone
number arewritten where thename,
address andtelephone number ofthe
attorney would normally bestated.
Thewords “inpropria persona” or“in
proper”aretyped where normally
itwould say“attorney forplaintiff.”
Judges sometimes warn aparty “in
propria persona”oftheoldadage that
“anyone who represents himself in
court hasafoolforaclient andanass
foranattorney.”

inquest: n.1)aninvestigation and/or
ahearing heldbythecoroner (a
county official) when there isavio-
lentdeath either byaccident or
homicide, thecause ofdeath isnot
immediately clear, there aremyste-
rious circumstances surrounding the

inre:prep, short for“inregard to”or
concerning. Often “inre” isfound
near thetopoflawyers’ letters to
identify thesubject matter, as“In
reMatheson v.Roth,” or“InreEs-
tateofRuth Bentley.” Itisalsoused
innaming legal actions inwhich
there isonlyone party, the peti-
tioning party, asin“InreAdoption
ofMarcus McGillicuddy.”
inrem: adj.from Latin “against or
about athing,” referring toalawsuit
orother legal action directed toward
property, rather thantoward apar-
ticular person. Thus, iftitle toprop-
erty isthe issue, theaction is
“inrem.” Theterm isimportant
since thelocation ofthepropertydetermines which court hasjurisdic-
tionandenforcement ofajudgment
must beupon theproperty anddoes
notfollow aperson. “Inrem” isdiffer-
entfrom “inpersonam,” which isdi-
rected toward aparticular person.
(See: inpersonam)
insanity: n.mental illness ofsuchase-
verenature thataperson cannot dis-
tinguish fantasy from reality, cannot
conduct her/his affairs due topsy-
chosis, orissubject touncontrollable
impulsive behavior. Insanity isdistin-
guished fromlowintelligence ormen-
taldeficiency duetoageorinjury. Ifa
complaint ismade tolawenforcement,
totheDistrict Attorney ortomedical
personnel thataperson isevidencing
psychotic behavior, he/shemaybecon-
fined toamedical facility longenough
(typically 72hours) tobeexamined by
psychiatrists whosubmit written re-
ports tothelocal superior/county/dis-
trict court.Ahearing isthen held be-
foreajudge, withtheperson inques-
tionentitled tolegal representation, to
determine ifshe/he should beplaced
inaninstitution orspecial facility. The
person ordered institutionalized at
thehearing mayrequest atrial tode-
termine sanity. Particularly since the
original hearings areoften routine
withthepsychiatric findings accepted
bythejudge. Incriminal cases, aplea
of“not guilty byreason ofinsanity”
willrequire atrialontheissue ofthe
defendant’s insanity (orsanity) atthe
time thecrime wascommitted. In
these cases thedefendant usually
claims “temporary insanity” (crazy
then, butokay now). The traditional
testofinsanity incriminal cases is
whether theaccused knew “the differ-
encebetween rightandwrong,” fol-
lowing the“M’Naughten rule” from
213

insanity defense
19thcentury England. Most states
require more sophisticated tests
based onpsychiatric and/or psycho-
logical testimony evaluated bya
jury oflaypersons orajudge with-
outpsychiatric training. Aclaim by
acriminal defendant ofhis/her in-
sanity atthetime oftrialrequires a
separate hearing todetermine ifa
defendant issufficiently sane toun-
derstand thenature ofatrialand
participate inhis/her own defense.
Iffound tobeinsane, thedefendant
willbeordered toamental facility,
andthe trial willbeheld only if
sanity returns. Sexoffenders may
befound tobesane forallpurposes
except thecompulsive dangerous
and/or antisocial behavior. They are
usually sentenced tospecial facili-
ties forsexoffenders, supposedly
withcounseling available. However,
there areoftenmaximum terms re-
lated tothetypeofcrime, sothat p-
arole andrelease may occur with
noproof ofcure ofthecompulsive
desire tocommit sexcrimes. (See:

age,which allows him/her tobeprivy toconfidential information (such
asfuture changes inmanagement, up-
coming profit andlossreports, secret
sales figures andmerger negotiations)
which willaffect thevalue ofstocks or

withbeing aninsider, useoftheconfi-

assets which might beavailable to
paythem, even iftheassets were
mortgaged orsold. 2)adetermina-
tionbyabankruptcy court thata
person orbusiness cannot raise the
funds topay allofhis/her debts. The
court willthen “discharge” (forgive)
some orallofthedebts, leaving
those creditors holding thebagand
notgetting what isowed them. The
supposedly insolvent individual
debtor, even though found tobe
bankrupt, isallowed certain exemp-

wanting toseethedocuments can
bring a“motion toproduce” request-
ingacourt order toproduce anda
penalty (sanctions) tobepaid for
failure tohonor thedemand. Aparty
may alsouseasubpena duces tecum
toobtain specific documents ifthey

cedures arepart ofthediscovery
process, intended togiveboth sidesextensive pre-trial information. Such
exchanges ofdocuments canlead to
settlement, minimize surprises at
trialandkeep onesidefrom hiding
material, thus preventing theother
from being able tointroduce relevant

either tohave allparties initial the

interlocutory: adj.provisional and
notintended tobefinal. Thisusu-
ally refers tocourt orders which
aretemporary. (See: interlocuto-

which theterms ofthedivorce were
stated inaninterlocutory decree,
which would beinforce until afinal

theory wasthat thiswould provide
foraperiod inwhich reconciliation
might bepossible andwould also
testtheefficacy oftheoriginal order

interrogatories: n.asetofwritten
questions toaparty toalawsuit
asked bytheopposing party aspart
ofthe pre-trial discovery process.
These questions must beanswered in

ofperjury within aspecified time
(such as30days). Several states ask
basic “form” interrogatories ona
printed form, with anallowance
for“supplemental” interrogatories

specifically relevant tothelawsuit.
Normal practice isforthelawyers
toprepare thequestions and for
theanswering party tohave help
from his/her/its attorney inunder-
standing themeaning (sometimes
hidden) ofthequestions and to
avoid wording inhis/her answers
which could beinterpreted against
theparty answering. Objections as
torelevancy orclarity may be
raised either atthetime theinter-
rogatories areanswered orwhen
they areused intrial.Most states
limit thenumber ofinterrogatories
thatmay beasked without the
court’s permission tokeep the
questions from being ameans of
oppression rather than asource of
information. While useful inget-
ting basic information, they are
much easier toaskthan answer

some. Inaddition theparties may
request depositions (pre-trial ques-
tioning infront ofacourt reporter)
orsend “requests foradmissions”

provided inthewill.Theclause isin-
tended todiscourage beneficiaries
fromcausing alegalruckus after the
willwriter isgone. However, ifthe
will ischallenged andfound tobein-
valid (due tolackofmental capacity,
undue influence orfailure tohave it
properly executed), then such aclause also fails.Soaprospective chal-
lenger takes his/her chances. The
courts have ruled thatmerely putting
inaclaim formoneys duefromthees-
tate isnotalegal challenge tothewill
itselfand ispermissible without losing
the gift. (See: will, willcontest)
inter se:(in-tur say) prep. Latin for

interstate commerce: n.commercial
trade, business, movement ofgoods or
money, ortransportation from one
state toanother, regulated bythefed-
eralgovernment according topowers
spelled outinArticle IoftheConstitu-
tion.Thefederal government canalso
regulate commerce within astate
when itmayimpact interstate move-
ment ofgoods andservices andmay
strike down state actions which are
barriers tosuchmovement under
Chief Justice John Marshall’s decision
inGibbons v.Ogden (1824). Theoreti-
callycommerce isregulated bythe
Interstate Commerce Commission
(I.C.C.) under authority granted by
theInterstate Commerce Act, firsten-
acted byCongress in1887. This au-
thority hasbeen diffused among vari-
ousfederal agencies, andtheI.C.C.
maysoonbehistory.
intervene: v.toobtain thecourt’s per-
mission toenter intoalawsuit which
hasalready started between other
parties and tofileacomplaint stat-
ingthebasis foraclaim intheexist-
inglawsuit. Such intervention will
beallowed only iftheparty wanting

219

intervening cause
unduly prejudice theability ofthe
original parties tothelawsuit to
conduct their case.Example: Little
Buttercup Butter Co.hasbeen
sued byMarket BagGrocers for
selling below standard butter. Bet-
terBuyMarket hasalsobeenbuy-
ingButtercup’s butter andwishes
tointervene (join inthelawsuit) to
avoid either alossbyMarket Bag
which would affect Better Buy’s
possible claim, and also toavoid

tercompany might want tojointhe
suitonButtercup’s sideinorder to
putupaunited front with Butter-
cupagainst themarkets. (See: in-
tervention, joinder, multiplici-
tyofsuits)
intervening cause: n.anevent
which occurs between theoriginal
improper ordangerous action and
thedamage itself. Thus, the“causal
connection” between thewrong and
damages isbroken bytheinterven-
ingcause. This isa“but for”situa-
tion, inwhich theintervention be-
comes therealreason harm result-
ed.The result isthat theperson
whostarted thechain ofevents isno
longer responsible and willnotbe
found liable fordamages tothein-
jured person. Example: FredFlame-
outnegligently starts awildfire by
welding onhishaybailer next toa

toward thenext-door ranch. Howev-
er,justasthecounty firedepart-

andRichard Rancher’s. Sparks fromthefirecause Petrol’s truck toexplode,
sending thefireontheway toRanch-
er’sbarns andhome, whichbum

vening cause which getsFlameout off
the liability hook. Sometimes this is
called supervening cause orsupersed-
ing.(See:cause, negligence, super-
seding cause)
intervention: n.theprocedure under
which athird partymay joinanon-
going lawsuit, providing the facts
andthelawissues apply tothein-
tervenor asmuch astooneoftheex-
isting contestants. Thedetermina-
tion toallow intervention ismade by
ajudge after apetition tointervene
andahearing ontheissue. Interven-
tionmust take place fairly early in
thelawsuit, shortly after acom-
plaint andanswer have been filed
andnotjust before trial since that
could prejudice oneorboth parties
whohave prepared fortrialonthe
basis oftheoriginal litigants. Inter-
vention isnottobeconfused with
joinder, which involves requiring all
parties whohave similar claims to
join inthesame lawsuit toprevent
needless repetitious trials based on
thesame factsand legal questions,
called multiplicity ofactions. (See:
intervene, joinder, multiplicity

inter vivos: (in-tur veye-vohs) adj.
Latin for“among theliving,” usually

inter vivos trust: n.atrust created
byawriting (declaration oftrust)
which commences atthat time,
while thecreator (called atrustor or

“living trust.” Theproperty isthen
placed intrustwithatrustee (often
thetrustor during his/her lifetime)
anddistribution willtake place ac-
cording totheterms ofthetrust—
possibly both during thetrustor’s
lifetime andthenupon thetrustor’s

mentary trust, which iscreated by
theterms ofawillandplaces some
assets from thedead person’s estate
inatrust toexistfrom thedate of
death and until fully distributed.
(See: declaration oftrust, inter

administration oftheestate ofa
person without awill ishandled by
anadministrator (usually aclose
relative, thespouse, aclose associ-
ate) orapublic administrator if
there isnoonewilling toact,since
there isnoexecutor named inawill.
Inmost states anadministrator
must petition thecourt tobeap-

joinder ofissue: n.thatpoint ina
lawsuit when thedefendant has
challenged (denied) some orallof
plaintiff’s allegations offacts,
and/or when itisknown which
legal questions areindispute. This
isstated intheexpression: “the
issue isjoined,” inthesameman-

joint: adj., adv.referring toproperty,
rights orobligations which are
united, undivided andshared by
two ormore persons orentities.
Thus, ajoint property heldbyboth
cannot beeffectively transferred
unless allowners joininthetrans-
action. Ifacreditor sues tocollect a
joint debt, he/she must include all
thedebtors inthelawsuit, unless
thedebt isspecifically “jointandseveral,” meaning anyone ofthe
debtors may beindividually liable.
Therefore, caremust betaken in
drafting deeds, sales agreements,
promissory notes, joint venture
agreements andother documents. A
joint tenancy istreated specially,
since itincludes theright ofthesur-
vivor togettheentire property when
theother dies(right ofsurvivorship).
(See: joint and several,, joint
tenancy, joint venture, tenancy
incommon)
joint adventure: n.when twoormore
people gotogether onatriporsome
other action, notnecessarily forprofit,
whichmaymakethem allliable foran
accident ordebt arising outoftheac-
tivity. (See:joint venture)
jointandseveral: adj.referring toa
debt orajudgment fornegligence, in
which each debtor (onewhoowes) or
eachjudgment defendant (onewho
hasajudgment against him/her) is
responsible (liable) fortheentire
amount ofthedebt orjudgment.
Thus, indrafting apromissory note
foradebt, itisimportant tostate
that ifthere ismore thanoneperson
owing thefunds tobepaid, thedebt
isjointand several, since then the
person owed money (creditor,
promisee) can collect the entire
amount fromanyofthejoint signers
ofthenote,andnotbelimited toa
share fromeach debtor. Ifaparty in-
jured inanaccident sues several
parties forcausing his/her damages,
thecourtmay findthat several peo-
plewere “jointly” negligent andcon-
tributed tothedamages. Theentire
judgment maybecollected fromany
ofthedefendants found responsible,
unless thecourt finds different
226

joint liability
amounts ofnegligence ofeach de-
fendant contributed totheinjury.
Defense attorneys should require
thetrier offact(jury orjudge sit-
tingwithout ajury) tobreakdown
theamount ofnegligence ofeach
defendant andtheplaintiff ifthere
iscontributory negligence. Often
thecourt willrefuse todoso,al-
lowing theplaintiff tocollect from
whichever defendant hasthe“deep
pocket” (lots ofmoney), andletting
thedefendant whopaysdemand
contributions fromtheother defen-
dants. (See:comparative negli-
gence, contribution, contribu-
tory negligence, joint, joint

joint custody: n.indivorce actions,
adecision bythecourt (often upon
agreement oftheparents) thatthe
parents willshare custody ofa
child. There aretwotypes ofcus-
tody, physical and legal. Joint
physical custody (instead ofone
parent having custody with the
other having visitation), does not
mean exact division oftime with
each parent, butcanbebased on
reasonable time witheach parent
either specifically spelled out(cer-
tain days, weeks, holidays, alter-
native periods) orbased onstated
guidelines andshared payment of
costs ofraising the child. Joint
legal custody means thatboth par-
entscanmake decisions forthe
child, including medical treat-
ment, butwhere possible they
should consult theother.Upon the
death ordisability ofeither parent,
legalcustody willgototheremain-
ingparent andwillgivetheactive
parent thesole ability toactas
parent forthechild without fur-therorder ofthecourt. Theprimary
affect ofthis isapsychological bene-
fitfortheparent andthechild, so
that achild canbetoldthatboth
parents cared forthe child, even
though thechildhad tolivemost of
thetime with one ofthem. (See:
child custody, dissolution of
marriage, divorce)
joint enterprise: n.ageneric term for
anactivity oftwoormore people,
usually (butnotnecessarily) forprof-
it,which may include partnership,
joint venture oranybusiness in
which morethanoneperson invests,
works, hasequalmanagement con-
troland/or isotherwise involved for
anagreed upon goalorpurpose. One
significant factor isthat ifacourt
finds thattwoormore people arein-
volved inajoint enterprise andthere
isnegligent damage toanoutside
party byanyoneoftheenterprisers,
orbreach ofacontract made bythe
joint enterprise, each ofthosewho
arepart oftheenterprise willbeli-
able forallthedamages totheparty.
However, notalljoint enterprises are
partnerships orjoint ventures, al-
though theterms areoften used im-
properly asiftheyweresynonymous.
(See: joint, joint adventure, joint
andseveral, joint liability, joint
venture, partnership)
joint liability: n.when twoormore
persons areboth responsible fora
debt, claim orjudgment. Itcanbe
important totheperson making the
claim, aswellastoaperson who is
sued,whocandemand thatanyone
with joint liability forthealleged
debt orclaim fordamages bejoined

cooperate with, orlend itspowers to
thespecial district orother govern-
ment entity.
Thelawmust bestable, but it

joint tenancy: n.acrucial relation-
ship intheownership ofrealprop-
erty, which provides that each
party owns anundivided interest
intheentire parcel, withbothhav-
ingtheright touseallofitandthe
right ofsurvivorship, which means
thatupon thedeath ofonejoint
tenant, theother has title toitall.
Procedurally, onthedeath ofone
joint tenant, title inthesurvivor is
completed byrecording an“affi-
davit ofdeath ofjoint tenant,” de-
scribing theproperty andthede-
ceased tenant, withadeath certifi-
cateattached, allofwhich issworn
tobythesurviving joint tenant.
This process avoids probate ofthe
property, butmayhavesome tax
consequences which should beex-
plored withanaccountant atthe
time ofrecording theoriginal deed.
Iftheowners donotwant full title
totheproperty topass tothesur-
vivor, then joint tenancy should
notbeused. Joint tenancy (aswell
asanyothercommon ownership)
between aparent andaminor
child should beavoided since the
property cannot betransferred in
thefuture without theparent be-
coming appointed aguardian of
the child’s estate bycourt order,andtheproperty andtheproceeds
therefrom willbeunder court control
until thechild is18.Incommunity
property states, some courts have
found that joint tenancy presumes
thattheproperty isnotcommunity
property (which could result inloss
ofestate taxlimitation onthedeath
ofthefirstspouse todie),butproof of
community interests canbeestab-
lished.Abank account held injoint
tenancy alsopresumes aright of
survivorship, but thispresumption
canbeovercome byevidence thatthe
account was really theproperty
ofonly one,andthejoint tenancy
was forconvenience. (See:commu-
nity property, tenancy incom-
mon, title)
joint tortfeasors: n.twoormore per-
sonswhose negligence inasingle ac-
cident orevent causes damages to
another person. Inmany cases the
joint tortfeasors arejointly andsev-
erally liable forthedamages, mean-
ingthatanyofthem canberesponsi-
bletopaytheentire amount, nomat-
terhowunequal thenegligence of
each party was. Example: Harry
Hotrod isdoing 90miles anhour
along atwo-lane road intheearly
evening, Adele Aimster hasstopped
hercartostudy amapwithhercar
sticking outintothelanebysixinch-
es.Hotrod swings outacouple offeet
tomiss Aimster’s vehicle, never
touches thebrake, and hitsVictor
Victim, driving from theother direc-
tion, killing him. While Hotrod is
grossly negligent forthehighspeed
andfailure toslowdown, Aimster is
alsonegligent forhercar’s slight in-
trusion intothelane.Asajoint tort-
feasor shemayhave topay allthe
damages, particularly ifHotrod has

nomoney orinsurance. However,
comparative negligence rules
bystatute orcase law inmost
jurisdictions willapportion the
liability bypercentages ofnegli-
gence among the tortfeasors
(wrongdoers) andtheinjured par-
ties. (See:comparative negli-
gence, negligence)
joint venture: n.anenterprise en-
tered intobytwoormore people
forprofit, foralimited purpose,
such aspurchase, improvement
andsaleorleasing ofrealestate.A
joint venture hasmost oftheele-
ments ofapartnership, such as
shared management, thepower of
eachventurer tobindtheothers in
thebusiness, division ofprofits
andjoint responsibility forlosses.
However, unlike apartnership,
ajointventure anticipates aspecif-
icarea ofactivity and/or period of
operation, soafter thepurpose
iscompleted, billsarepaid, profits
(or losses) are divided, and
thejoint venture isterminated.

jurisdiction: n.theauthority given
bylawtoacourt totrycasesand
ruleonlegalmatters within apar-
ticular geographic areaand/or over
certain types oflegal cases. Itis
vital todetermine before alawsuit
isfiledwhich court hasjurisdic-
tion. State courts have jurisdiction
overmatters within that state,and
different levels ofcourts have ju-
risdiction over lawsuits involving
different amounts ofmoney. For
example, Superior Courts (called
District orCounty Courts insever-
alstates) generally have solecon-
troloflawsuits forlarger sums of
money, domestic relations (di-
vorces), probate ofestates ofde-
ceased persons, guardianships,
conservatorships and trials of
felonies. Insome states (likeNew
York) probate and certain other
matters arewithin thejurisdictionofso-called Surrogate Courts. Mu-
nicipal courts (orother local courts)
have jurisdiction over cases involv-
inglesser amounts ofmoney, misde-
meanors (crimes notpunishable by
state prison), traffic matters and
preliminary hearings onfelony
charges todetermine ifthere issuffi-
cient evidence towarrant atrialby
theSuperior Court. Some states
have police courts tohandle misde-
meanors. Jurisdiction inthecourts
ofaparticular statemaybedeter-
mined bythelocation ofrealproper-
tyinastate (inremjurisdiction), or
whether theparties arelocated with-
inthestate (inpersonam jurisdic-
tion). Thus, aprobate ofMarsha
Blackwood’s estate would beinIdaho
where shelivedand died, butjuris-
diction overhertitle torealestate in
Utah willbeunder thejurisdiction of
theUtah courts. Federal courts have
jurisdiction over lawsuits between
citizens ofdifferent states, cases
based onfederal statutes such asfair
labor standards andantitrust viola-
tions, charges offederal crimes, ap-
peals frombankruptcy proceedings,
maritime cases orlegal actions in-
volving federal constitutional ques-
tions. Sometimes regulatory agen-
cieshave theinitial jurisdiction be-
foreanylegal actionmaybefiled in
court. More thanonecourtmayhave
concurrent jurisdiction, such asboth
state and federal courts, andthe
lawyer filing thelawsuit mayhave to
make atactical decision astowhich
jurisdiction ismore favorable oruse-
fultohis/her cause, including time to
gettotrial, thepotential pool ofju-
rorsorother considerations. Appel-
latejurisdiction isgiven bystatute to
appeals courts tohearappeals about
thejudgment ofthelower court that
232

jury
tried acase,and toorder reversal
orother correction iferror isfound.
State appeals areunder thejuris-
diction ofthe state appellate
courts, while appeals from federal
district courts arewithin thejuris-
diction ofthecourts ofappeal and
eventually theSupreme Court.
Jurisdiction isnottobeconfused
with “venue,” which means
thebest place totryacase. Thus,
anystate courtmayhave jurisdic-
tionoveramatter, butthe“venue”
isinaparticular county. (See: dis-
trict court, municipal court,
police court, Superior Court,
Supreme Court, venue)
jurisdictional amount: n.therange
between theminimum andmaxi-
mumamount ofmoney orvalue in
dispute inalawsuit (generally based
ontheamount demanded inthelaw-
suit),which determines which court
hasjurisdiction totrythecase. Ex-
ample: inCalifornia, municipal
courts have jurisdiction upto
$25,000, superior courts have juris-
diction over thatsum, andsmall
claims courts (analternative tofor-
malmunicipal court filing) have a
maximum jurisdictional amount of
$5,000. Federal jurisdiction com-
mences atthe$10,000 level, ifthe
lawsuit fitsother federal require-
ments. (See:jurisdiction)
jurisprudence: n.theentire sub-
jectoflaw,thestudy oflawand

Juris Doctor (J.D.): n.thelawde-
greegranted upon graduation by
many university lawschools with

tlesaperson toagraduate degree.
jurist: n.although itmeans anyattor-
neyorlegal scholar, jurist popularly
refers toajudge.
juror: n.anyperson who actually
serves onajury. Lists ofpotential ju-
rorsarechosen from various sources
such asregistered voters, automobile
registration ortelephone directories.
Thenames aredrawn bylot(more
often bycomputer random selection)
andrequested toappear forpossible
service. Before atrial begins the
names ofjurors areassigned toatrial
court, andafurther selection process
ismade. Acceptable excuses from ser-
vicearedetermined bystatelaworby
thejudge before orduring thefinal
selection process. Ifchosen, ajuror re-
ceives asmallamount ofpayperday

bilemileage fromhome tocourt.A
member ofaGrand Jury iscalled a
grand juror. (See:Grand Jury, jury,

tions oftheEnglish common law
(from theAngles andSaxons, but
alsoemployed inNormandy prior to
theNorman Conquest in1066), itis

tothemembers ofthejury (jurors)
in“jury instructions.” Thecommon
number ofjurors is12(dating back
athousand years), butsome states
allow asmaller number (sixor
eight) iftheparties agree. Fora
plaintiff (theparty suing) towina
lawsuit withajury, three-quarters
ofthejurors must favor theclaim.
Guilt orinnocence inacriminal
trialrequires aunanimous decision
ofthejury, except twostates (Ore-
gonandLouisiana) allow aconvic-
tionwith 10of12jurors. Juries
have greatly changed inrecent
decades, astheterm “impartial
jury” intheFifthAmendment to
theConstitution requires thatthe
pool ofjurors must include all
races, ethnic groups andwomen as
wellasmen inpercentages relative
tothegeneral population. Any fail-
uretoachieve thatbalance orsys-
tematic challenges tothose ofthe
same ethnicity oftheaccused, may
result inaclaim onappeal thatthe
jurywasnotfair—inpopular jar-
gon,not“ajuryofone’s peers.” This
doesnotmean thataSamoan male
must betried byother Samoan
males, but itdoesmean that the
potential jurors mustcome from a
balanced group. Members ofthe
juryaresupposed tobefreeofbias,
have nospecific knowledge ofthe
caseandhave noconnection with
any oftheparties orwitnesses.
Questions areasked bythejudge
andattorneys (called “voir dire”)
during jury selection toweed out
thosewhom theymaychallenge on
those grounds (challenge for
cause). Some potential jurors are
challenged (peremptory challenge)
because theattorney foronesideor
theother feelsthere issomehiddenbias. Inwell-financed cases thishas
ledtothehiring ofjury “specialists”
andpsychologists byattorneys toaid
injury selection. Inahigh-profile
criminal case inwhich thejurymight
beinfluenced bypublic comment or
media coverage during trial, the
courtmay order thejury bese-
questered (kept inahotelaway from
family, friends, radio, television and
newspapers.) (See: challenge for
cause, juror, jury panel, jury

jury fees: n.therather minimal
amount paideachdaytojurors, plus
payment formileage fromhome to

paidbythegovernment (usually coun-
tygovernment instate cases), butin
civillawsuits thejury feesarepaidby
theparties tothelawsuit inequal
amounts. Itisimportant foraparty

jury ofone’s peers: n.aguaranteed
right ofcriminal defendants, inwhich
“peer” means an“equal.” This has
been interpreted bycourts tomean
that theavailable jurors include a
broad spectrum ofthepopulation,
particularly ofrace, national origin
234

justice
andgender. Jury selection may in-
clude noprocess which excludes
those ofaparticular race orinten-
tionally narrows thespectrum of
possible jurors. Itdoes notmean
thatwomen are tobetried by
women, Asians byAsians, orAfrican
Americans byAfrican Americans.

presenting evidence andargument
incourt, including conversations
about thecase outside thecourt,
offering bribes, making threats or
asking acquaintances tointercede
withajuror. (See: jury, suborna-

jury trial: n.atrial ofalawsuit or
criminal prosecution inwhich thecase ispresented toajuryandthe
factual questions andthefinaljudg-
ment aredetermined byajury. This
isdistinguished from a“court trial”
inwhich thejudge decides factual as
well aslegal questions, andmakes
thefinaljudgment. (See:jury)
justcompensation: n.1)ingeneral a
fairandreasonable amount ofmoney

forproperty taken bythegovernment
forpublic purposes guaranteed bythe
FifthAmendment totheU.S.Consti-
tution, which states: “...nor shall pri-
vateproperty betaken forpublic use
without just compensation.” Ifthe
amount offered bythegovernmental
agency taking theproperty isnotcon-
sidered sufficient, theproperty owner
maydemand atrial todetermine just
compensation. (See:condemnation,

justice: n.1)fairness. 2)moral right-
ness. 3)ascheme orsystem oflaw
inwhich every person receives his/
her/its duefromthesystem, including
allrights, bothnatural and legal.One
problem isthatattorneys, judges and
legislatures often getcaught upmore
inprocedure than inachieving justice
for all.Example: theadage “justice
delayed isjustice denied,” applies to
theburdensome procedures, lack of
sufficient courts, theclogging ofthe
system with meritless cases andthe
useofthecourts tosettle matters
which could beresolved bynegotia-

justice ofthepeace (JP): n.a
judge who handles minor legal
matters such asmisdemeanors,
small claims actions and traffic
matters in“justice courts.” Dating
back toearly English common law,
“JPs” were verycommon uptothe
1950s, buttheynowexist primari-
lyinrural “justice districts” from
which itisunreasonable forthe
public totravel tothecounty seat
fortrials ofminor matters. In
Nevada justices ofthepeace are
lucrative jobs since theyperform
many ofthemarriages ofelopers
from other states, asNevada has
nowaiting period from license to
wedding. Ajustice ofthepeace is
usually anattorney, butsome
states still allow laypersons to
qualify bytaking atest.
justiciable: n.referring toamatter
which iscapable ofbeing decided by
acourt. Usually itiscombined in
such terms as:“justiciable issue,”
“justiciable cause ofaction” or“justi-

juvenile court: n.aspecial court or
department ofatrial court which
deals with under-age defendants
charged with crimes orwhoarene-
glected oroutofthecontrol oftheir
parents. Thenormal ageofthese de-
fendants isunder 18,butjuvenile
court does nothave jurisdiction in
cases inwhich minors arecharged as
adults. Theprocedure injuvenile
court isnotalways adversarial (al-
though theminor isentitled tolegal
representation byalawyer). Itcan

kidnapping (also spelled kidnap-
ing): n.thetaking ofaperson
against his/her will (orfrom the
control ofaparent orguardian)
from oneplace toanother under
circumstances inwhich theperson
sotaken does nothave freedom
ofmovement, will, ordecision
through violence, force, threat or
intimidation. Although itisnot
necessary that thepurpose be
criminal (since allkidnapping isa
criminal felony) thecapture usual-
lyinvolves some related criminal
actsuch asholding theperson for
ransom, sexual and/or sadistic
abuse, orrape. Itincludes taking
due toirresistible impulse anda
parent taking andhiding achild in
violation ofcourt order.Aninclud-edcrime isfalseimprisonment. Any
harm tothevictim coupled with kid-
napping can raise thedegree of
felony fortheinjury andcanresult
inacapital (death penalty) offense in
some states, eventhough thevictim
survives. Originally itmeant the
stealing ofchildren, since “kid” is
child inScandinavian languages, but
nowapplies toadults aswell.

lastantecedent rule: n.adoctrine
ofinterpretation (construction) of
statutes thatanyqualifying words or

ately preceding the qualifier, unless
common sense shows that itwas
meant toapply tosomething more dis-

andunder three tons” applies only to
trucks andnotboats ortractors.
lastclear chance: n.aruleoflawin
determining responsibility fordam-

fendant (the party being sued for
damages caused byhis/her negli-
gence) could have stillavoided the
accident byreasonable care inthe
final moments (nomatter how

against any slippage, cave-in or
landslide. Should the adjoining
owner excavate intothesoilforany
reason (foundation, basement, level-

precepts aswell ascommon under-
standing offairness andjustice). 3)n.

every legal subject. Almost allcollec-
tions ofstatutes, digests, formbooks
andcommentaries areregularly
updated with thelatest decisions,
legislative enactments and recent
comments, often with loose-leaf
“pocket parts” added each year,and
completely newvolumes when nu-

leading: 1)v.short for“leading thewit-
ness,” inwhich theattorney during a
trial ordeposition asksquestions ina
form inwhich he/she putswords inthe
mouth ofthewitness orsuggests the
answer. Leading isimproper iftheat-
torney isquestioning awitness called
bythat attorney andpresumably
friendly totheattorney’s side ofthe
case.Thus, theopposing attorney will
object thataquestion is“leading,” and
ifsothejudge willsustain (uphold) the
objection andprohibit thequestion in
thatform. However, leading questions
arepermissible incross-examination

leading question: n.aquestion asked
ofawitness byanattorney during
atrial oradeposition (questioning
under oath outside ofcourt), suggest-
ingananswer orputting words inthe

243

leading thewitness
isoften objected to,usually withthe
simple objection: “leading.” Aleading
question isallowable onlywhen di-
rected totheopposing party tothe
lawsuit ortoan“adverse witness”
during cross-examination (the
chance toquestion after direct testi-
mony) onthebasis thatsuchawit-
nesscanreadily deny theproposed
wording. Typical improper leading
question: “Didn’t thedefendant ap-
pear toyoutobegoing toofastinthe
limited visibility?” Theproper ques-
tionwould be:“How fastdoyouesti-
mate thedefendant wasgoing?” fol-
lowed by“What wasthevisibility?”
and“How farcould yousee?” (See:
cross-examination, objection)

lease: 1)n.awritten agreement in
which theowner ofproperty (either
real estate orsome object likean
automobile) allows useoftheprop-
erty foraspecified period oftime
(term) forspecific periodic pay-
ments (rent), andother terms and
conditions. Leases ofrealproperty
describe thepremises (often byad-
dress); penalties forlatepayments,
termination upon default ofpay-
ment orbreach ofany significant
conditions; increases inrentbased
oncost ofliving orsome otherstandard; inclusion orexclusion of
property taxesandinsurance inrent;
limitations onuse(forabutcher shop,
aresidence forthefamily only, no
pets); charges forstaying onbeyond
theterm (holding over); anyright to
renew thelease foranother period;
and/or arequirement forpayment of
attorneys’ feesandcosts incaseofthe
need toenforce thelease (including
eviction). Alease isdistinguished
from amere renting ofthepremises
onamonth-to-month basis andcan-
notexceed ayearunless agreed toin
writing. A“triple net” lease includes
both taxesandinsurance intherent.
2)v.torentoutrealproperty oranob-
jectpursuant toawritten agreement.
(See:holding over tenancy, lease,
leasehold, real property, rent,
statute offrauds, triple netlease,

leasehold: n.therealestate which is
thesubject ofalease (awritten rental
agreement foranextended period of
time). Theterm iscommonly used to
describe improvements onrealprop-
ertywhen theimprovements arebuilt
onlandowned byoneparty which is
leased foralongterm (such as99
years) totheowner ofthebuilding.
Forexample, thePacific LandCom-
panyowns alotandleases itfor99
years totheHighrise Development
Corporation, which builds a20-story
apartment building and sells each
apartment toindividual owners as
condominiums. Attheendofthe99
years thebuilding hastobemoved

ic(which need notpaymuch since the
building isoldandHighrise hasno
choice), oranewlease negotiated. Ob-
viously, toward theend ofthe99
years theindividual condominiums

willgodown invalue, partly from
fear oflessened resale potential.
This isgenerally theoretical (except
tolending companies because the
security does notinclude theland)
since there arefewbuildings with
lessthan50or60years togoonthe
leases ortheir expected lifetimes,
although there aresomecommer-
cialbuildings which arewithin 20
years oftermination ofsuch leases.
Inmost cases thebuildings areob-
solete bytheendoftheleasehold.

legacy: n.agiftofpersonal property
ormoney toabeneficiary (legatee)
ofawill.While technically legacy
does notinclude real property
(which isa“devise”), legacy usually
refers toany giftfrom theestate of
onewhohasdied. Itissynonymous
with theword “bequest.” (See:ben-
eficiary, bequest, legatee, will)
legal: adj., adv.according tolaw,not
inviolation oflaworanything relat-
edtothelaw.
legal action: n.anylawsuit, peti-
tionorprosecution.
legal advertising: n.1)notices of
probate salesandother documents
required bylawtobepublished in
court-approved localnewspapers of
general circulation. 2)commercials
forthelegal services oflawyers and
lawfirms, whichmayrange from
television spots with actors togar-
ishadsintelephone books’ yellow
pages. Such advertising would have
been cause fordisbarment forille-
gal solicitation oflegal services
until theU.S.Supreme Court ruled
in1977 that restrictions onadvertising professional services were
unconstitutional abridgments offree
speech. While legal advertising may
have thebenefit ofannouncing spe-
cialties likeworker’s compensation or
bankruptcy, the size, frequency and
message bear little relationship tothe
quality ofthelawyers advertising.
(See:attorney advertising)
legal age: n.theageatwhich aperson
isresponsible forhis/her ownactions
(including thecapacity toenter intoa
contract which isenforceable bythe
other party), fordamages fornegli-
gence orintentional wrongs without a
parent being liable and forpunish-
ment asanadult foracrime. Inalmost
allstates thebasic legal age is18,

legal aidsociety: n.anorganization
formed toassist persons whohave lim-
itedornofinancial means butneed
legal help, usually sponsored bythe
localbarassociation’s donations, some-
times withsome local governmental
financial support. Such societies exam-
inetheassets andincome oftheappli-
cant, decide iftheperson hasalegiti-
mate need forlegal services, give
counselling, provide mediation, pre-
pare simple documents, and ifab-
solutely necessary givefreelegal assis-
tance fromapanel ofvolunteer attor-
neys. Originally most prevalent in
larger cities, legal aidsocieties exist
245

legalduty
throughout thecountry. They donot
usually provide assistance incrimi-
nalcases because indigent defen-
dants areconstitutionally entitled to
representation byapublic defender
orappointed private counsel paidby
thegovernment. Some societies pro-
vide referral services tohelpaper-
sonfindasuitable attorney, butnor-
mally referral ismade bythelocal
barassociation. (See:probono )
legal duty: n.theresponsibility to
others toactaccording tothelaw.
Proving theduty (such asnottobe

legalese: n.slang forthesometimes
arcane, convoluted andspecialized
jargon oflawyers andlegal scholars.
legal fiction: n.apresumption of

lawfrom fictions.”
legal separation: n.acourt-decreed
right toliveapart, with therights
and obligations ofdivorced per-
sons, butwithout divorce. Thepar-
tiesare stillmarried andcannot re-
marry.Aspouse may petition fora
legal separation usually onthe
same basis asforadivorce, andin-
clude requests forchild custody,
alimony, child support anddivision
ofproperty. Forpeople whowant
toavoid thesupposed stigma ofdivorce, whoholdstrong religious ob-
jections todivorce orwhohope to
saveamarriage, legal separation is
anapparent solution. With more
states allowing no-fault divorce, the
useofseparation agreements and in-
formal separation, legal separation is
rarely used. (See:divorce)
legal services: n.thework performed
byalawyer foraclient.
legal tender: n.allmoney issued bythe
government.
legatee: n.aperson ororganization re-
ceiving agiftofanobject ormoney
under theterms ofthewillofaperson
whohasdied.Although technically a
legatee doesnotreceive realproperty
(adevisee), “legatee” isoften used to
designate aperson who takes any-
thing pursuant (according) tothe
terms ofawill.Thebestgeneric term
isbeneficiary, which avoids theold-
fashioned distinctions between lega-
teestaking legacies (personal proper-
ty)anddevisees taking devises (real
property), terms which datefrom the
Middle Ages. (See: beneficiary, de-
vise, devisee, legacy, will)
legitimate: adj., adv.: 1)legal, proper,

lesser crime: n.(See: lesser-in-

gers ischarged witharmed robbery,
buttheprosecution fails toprove
Itchy used hispistol since the vic-
timsdonotrecall thegun,butdoes
prove hetookthejewels. Thus, heis
convicted oflarceny, which isaless-
erform oftheftandhewillreceive a
lighter sentence. Acommon example
istheso-called “wet reckless,” which
isthecrime ofdriving recklessly
aftersome drinking, butnotneces-
sarily while drunk. Inpleabargains
forfirstoffenders inclose cases the
drivermayplead guilty or“nocon-

instead ofdrunk driving, which car-
riesamore severe penalty, including
jailtime. (See:pleabargain)

2)v.toborrow most ofthefunds nec-
essary asaloanagainst realestate

areover-appraisal oftheproperty to

havebeenpurchased during aperi-
odofhigh inflation), high carrying
costs (interest, insurance, taxes,
maintenance) which exceed income,vacancies and/or inability tofinance
improvements toincrease profits. Too
often the result isthecollapse of
“paper” real estate empires which
havebeen created byrisky leveraging.

pleliving together whoareknown not
tobemarried, entertainment which
aims atarousing thelibido orprimar-
ilysexual sensation, open solicitation
forprostitution orindecent exposure
ofgenitalia (which isitself acrime).
Due tothetendency ofjudges tobe
overly careful inwriting about moral
and/or sexual matters thedefinitions
have been cloaked inold-fashioned
modesty. Today theterm usually ap-
plies topornography, prostitution and
indecent acts. (See:indecent expo-
sure,pornography, prostitution)
liability: n.oneofthemost significant
words inthe field oflaw, liability
248

libel
means legal responsibility forone’s
actsoromissions. Failure ofaper-
sonorentity tomeet thatresponsi-
bility leaves him/her/it open toa
lawsuit foranyresulting damages
oracourt order toperform (asina
breach ofcontract orviolation of
statute). Inorder towinalawsuit
thesuing party (plaintiff) must
prove thelegal liability ofthede-
fendant iftheplaintiff’s allegations
areshown tobetrue.Thisrequires
evidence oftheduty toact,the fail-
uretofulfill thatdutyandthecon-
nection (proximate cause) ofthat
failure tosome injury orharm to
the plaintiff. Liability also applies
toalleged criminal acts inwhich
thedefendant mayberesponsible
forhis/her actswhich constitute a
crime, thusmaking him/her subject
toconviction andpunishment. Ex-
ample: JackJumpstart runsastop
sign inhiscarandhitsSarah Step-
forth asshe iscrossing inthecross-
walk. Jack hasaduty ofcare to
Sarah (and thepublic) which he
breaches byhisnegligence, and
therefore has liability forSarah’s
injuries, giving hertheright to
bring alawsuit against him.How-
ever, Jack’s father owns theauto-
mobile andhe,too,mayhave liabil-
itytoSarah based onastatute
which makes acarowner liable for
anydamages caused bythevehicle
heowns. Thefather’s responsibility
isbased on“statutory liability”
even though he personally
breached noduty.Asigner ofa
promissory note has liability for
money due ifitisnotpaidandso
would aco-signer whoguarantees
it.Acontractor whohasagreed to
complete abuilding has liability to
theowner ifhefails tocomplete ontime. (See: contract, joint liability,
joint tortfeasors, negligence)
liable: adj.responsible orobligated.
Thus, aperson orentitymaybeli-
able fordamages duetonegligence,
liable topayadebt, liable toperform
anactwhich he/she/it contracted to
do,orliable topunishment forcom-
mission ofacrime. Failure tomeet
theresponsibility orobligation opens
oneuptoalawsuit, andcommitting
acrime canlead toacriminal prose-
cution. (See: liability)
libel: 1)n.topublish inprint (includ-
ingpictures), writing orbroadcast
through radio, television orfilm,an
untruth about another which willdo
harm tothatperson orhis/her repu-
tation, bytending tobring thetarget
into ridicule, hatred, scorn orcon-
tempt ofothers. Libel isthewritten
orbroadcast form ofdefamation, dis-
tinguished from slander, which is
oraldefamation. Itisatort (civil
wrong) making theperson orentity
(likeanewspaper, magazine orpolit-
icalorganization) open toalawsuit
fordamages bytheperson whocan
prove thestatement about him/her
wasalie.Publication need onlybeto
oneperson, but itmust beastate-
ment which claims tobefactand is
notclearly identified asanopinion.
While itissometimes saidthatthe
person making thelibelous state-
ment must have been intentional
andmalicious, actually itneed only
beobvious thatthestatement would
doharmand isuntrue. Proof ofmal-
ice,however, does allow aparty
defamed tosueforgeneral damages
fordamage toreputation, while
aninadvertent libel limits thedam-
ages toactual harm (such aslossof
249

libelperse
business) called special damages.
Libel perseinvolves statements so
vicious thatmalice isassumed and
doesnotrequire aproof ofintent to
getanaward ofgeneral damages.
Libel against thereputation ofa
person whohasdied willallow sur-
viving members ofthefamily to
bring anaction fordamages. Most
states provide foraparty defamed
byaperiodical todemand apub-
lished retraction. Ifthecorrection
ismade, then there isnoright to
filealawsuit. Governmental bod-
iesaresupposedly immune toac-
tions forlibel onthebasis that
there could benointent byanon-
personal entity, andfurther, public
records areexempt from claims of
libel.However, there isatleastone
known case inwhich therewasa
financial settlement aswell asa
published correction when astate
government newsletter incorrectly
stated thatadentist hadbeen dis-
ciplined forillegal conduct. The
rules covering libelagainst a“pub-
licfigure” (particularly apolitical
orgovernmental person) arespe-
cial,based onU.S.Supreme Court
decisions. Thekey isthat touphold
theright toexpress opinions orfair
comment onpublic figures, the
libelmust bemalicious toconsti-
tutegrounds foralawsuit fordam-
ages.Minor errors inreporting are
not libel, such assaying Mrs.
Jones was55when shewasonly
48,orgetting anaddress ortitle
incorrect. 2)v.tobroadcast orpub-
lishawritten defamatory state-
ment. (See: defamation, libel

libelper se:n.broadcast orwritten
publication ofafalse statementabout another which accuses him/her
ofacrime, immoral acts, inability to
perform his/her profession, having a
loathsome disease (like syphilis) or

lienor: n.aperson whoholds alienon
another’s property orfunds. (See: lien)
lifeestate: n.theright touseoroccu-
pyrealproperty forone’s life.Often
this isgiven toaperson (such asa

under awillwith theidea that a
younger person would thentakethe
property upon thedeath oftheone
who receives the lifeestate. Title
may alsoreturn totheperson giving
ordeeding theproperty ortohis/her
surviving children ordescendants
upon thedeath ofthe lifetenant—
this iscalled “reversion.” Example of
creation ofalifeestate: “Igrant tomy
mother, Molly McCree, theright to
liveinand/or receive rents from said
realproperty, until herdeath,” or“I
givemydaughter, Sadie Hawkins,
said real property, subject toalife

lifewithout possibility ofparole
lifewithout possibility ofparole:
n.asentence sometimes given for
particularly vicious criminals in
murder cases ortorepeat felons,
particularly ifthecrime iscommit-
tedinastate which hasnodeath
penalty, thejurychooses nottoim-
posethedeath penalty, orthejudge
feels itissimpler tolocktheprison-
erupand“throw away thekey”
rather than invite years ofappeals
while theprisoner languishes on
death row.Opponents ofcapital
punishment often advocate this
penalty asasubstitute forexecu-
tion. Itguarantees thecriminal will
notendanger thepublic, andthe
prospect ofnever being outside
prison issevere punishment. Con-
traryarguments arethat thispenal-
tydoesnotdeter murderers, there is
always thepossibility ofescape or
killing aguard orfellow prisoner, or
some soft-hearted Governor may
someday reduce thesentence. (See:
three strikes, you’re out)
limitation ofactions: n.theperiod
oftime inwhich aperson hastofile
withtheclerk ofthecourt orappro-
priate agency what he/she believes
isavalid lawsuit orclaim. Thepe-
riod varies greatly depending on
what type ofcase isinvolved,
whether thesuit isagainst thegov-
ernment, whether itisbyaminor,
andmost importantly, inwhat state
orfederal jurisdiction theright to
suearose. This ismorecommonly
called thestatute oflimitations,
which arespecific periods forvari-
ousclaims ineach state. (See:
statute oflimitations)
limited jurisdiction: n.courts’ au-
thority over certain types ofcasessuch asbankruptcy, claims against
thegovernment, probate, family
matters, immigration andcustoms
orlimitations oncourts’ authority
totrycases involving maximum
amounts ofmoney orvalue. (See:
court, jurisdiction)
limited partnership: n.aspecial
type ofpartnership which isvery
common when people need funding
forabusiness, orwhen they are
putting together aninvestment ina
real estate development. Alimited
partnership requires awritten
agreement between thebusiness
management, who is(are) general
partner orpartners, and allofthe
limited partners. Each limited part-
nermakes aninvestment offunds
intothepartnership and issupposed
toreceive apre-stated share oftheTheardor and stress ofconflict
arenotfavorable toabstract con-
siderations ofjustice.—Chief Justice Harlan F.Stone
limited liability: n.themaximum
amount aperson participating ina
business canloseorbecharged incase
ofclaims against thecompany orits
bankruptcy. Astockholder inacorpo-
ration canonly lose his/her invest-
ment, andalimited partner camonly
losehis/her investment, butageneral
partner camberesponsible forallthe
debts ofthepartnership. Parties toa
contract can limit theamount each
might owetheother, butcannot con-
tractaway therights ofathird party
tomake aclaim. (See: corporation,

profit, which isordinarily greater
than that ofeach ofthegeneral
partners uptoapoint (such asre-
turn oftheinvestment), and,
thereafter, thelimited partners
willreceive alesser share than the
general partner(s). The limited
partners also willreceive thetax
benefit ofa“passed through” loss
(apersonal income taxdeduction
forpart oftheloss)during thede-
velopment stages ofthepartner-
shipwhen theexpenses exceed any
receipts. Quite often there isalsoa
provision foreventual buy-out of
thelimited partners bythegener-
alpartner(s). Thelimited partners
may notparticipate intheman-
agement decisions ofthepartner-
ship orthey willlosetheir limited
partnership status. They dohave
thepower tovote toremove the
general partner(s), although usu-
allythepartnership agreement is
structured sothatsuchremoval is
virtually impossible unless the
general partner inquestion has
committed fraud. Since thelimited
investors have nocontrol ofthe
conduct overthepartnership, they
should make sure theyhave con-
siderable knowledge about therep-
utation andrecord ofthegeneral
partner(s) and thetype ofbusi-
ness. Infact, state laws require
thatthere besome pre-existing ac-
quaintanceship between thegener-
alandthelimited partners orade-
tailed prospectus provided bythe
general partner(s) meeting very
stringent and specific federal re-
quirements ofdisclosure. Themax-
imum number oflimited partners

shipasiftheywere shares ofstockinacorporation. Inaddition toprior-
ityinprofit, taxdeductions, andpo-
tential share inthesuccess oftheen-

ited” inpotential loss, since all
he/she can lose ishis/her invest-
ment, and thegeneral partners
alone aresubject toclaims, debts in
bankruptcy andlawsuits against the
partnership. Limited partnerships
must filetheirname andnames and
addresses ofgeneral partners with
theSecretary ofState orother
designated officer inthestate in
which thepartnership iscreated so
thepublic canfindoutwhothere-
sponsible parties are.Likeacorpora-
tion, alimited partnership maynot
have aname which istoosimilar to

used inanattempt tohave awitness
orvictim identify aperson suspected
ofcommitting acrime. Thesuspect
isincluded inalineofpeople, includ-

(See:wind up)
liquidated damages: n.anamount
ofmoney agreed uponbyboth par-
ties toacontract which one will
pay totheother upon breaching
(breaking orbacking out of)the
agreement orifalawsuit arises
due tothebreach. Sometimes the
liquidated damages are the
amount ofadeposit oradown pay-
ment, orarebased onaformula
(such as10% ofthecontract
amount). Thenon-defaulting party
may obtain ajudgment forthe
amount ofliquidated damages,
often based onastipulation (clear
statement) contained inthecon-
tract, unless theparty whohas
breached thecontract canmake a
strong showing thattheamount of
liquidated damages wasso“uncon-
scionable” (fartoohighunder the
circumstances) that itappears

ingorbasic unfairness. (See:con-

lispendens :(lease pen-dense) n.
Latin for“asuitpending,” awritten
notice thatalawsuit hasbeen filed
which concerns the title toreal
property orsome interest inthat
real property. The lispendens (ornotice ofpending action) isfiledwith
theclerk ofthecourt, certified that it
hasbeen filed,andthenrecorded with
theCounty Recorder. This gives notice
tothedefendant whoowns realestate
thatthere isaclaim ontheproperty,
andtherecording informs thegeneral
public (and particularly anyone inter-
ested inbuying orfinancing theprop-
erty) thatthere isthispotential claim
against it.The lispendens must in-
clude alegal description ofthereal
property, andthelawsuit must in-
volve theproperty. Otherwise, ifthere
isapetition toremove the lispendens
from realproperty notinvolved inthe
lawsuit, theplaintiff who originally
recorded afalse lispendens willbe
subject topayment ofattorney’s fees
asapenalty. Example: JoePlumbob

Smith’s home, sues toenforce ame-
chanic’s hen,butrecords alispendens
describing three other properties
owned bySmith; Plumbob canbepe-
nalized bycourt order.
literary property: n.thewritings ofan
author which entitles him/her tothe

andsaleorlicense foraprofit tooth-
erswho willthenhave theright to
publish it.Literary property includes
books, articles, poetry, movie scripts,
computer programs andanywriting
which lends itself topublication or
use.Aclose question canarisewhen a
professional writer sends letters to
others: arethey literary property?
Probably not iftheywereintended to
bejustpersonal communications. J.
D.Salinger, author ofTheCatcher in

it,andpursue minor matters which
donotdeserve judicial attention.
Some ofthese people arecalled “pro-
fessional plaintiffs.”
living trust: n.sometimes called an
inter vivos (Latin for“within one’s
life”) trust, atrust created byadec-

trustor ortrustors (also called settlor
orsettlors) during his/her/their life-

long-arm statute
hasnoparticular orlegal purpose.
Inmany states, cities andtowns
there arestatutes orordinances
against loitering bywhich thepo-
licecanarrest someone who refus-
esto“move along.” There isaques-
tionastowhether such laws are
constitutional. However, there is
often another criminal statute or
ordinance which canbeapplied
specifically tocontrol aggressive
begging, soliciting prostitution,
drug dealing, blocking entries to
stores, public drunkenness or
being apublic nuisance.
long-arm statute: n.lawwhich
gives alocal state court jurisdiction
overanout-of-state company orin-
dividual whose actions caused dam-
age locally ortoalocal resident.
Thelegal test iswhether theout-of-
statedefendant hascontacts within
the state which are “sufficiently
substantial.” Anaccident orinjury
within thestate usually shows such
asubstantial contact. This ispartic-
ularly important when adriver
from onestate issued inanother
state fordamages caused byhis/her
negligence there. Italsocanbeem-
ployed ifaproduct shipped from
out-of-state fails, explodes orcauses
damage toalocal person whosues
inthestate where he/she resides.
The long-arm statute allows
him/her togetlocal court jurisdic-
tionoverthedefendant.
long cause: n.alawsuit inwhich it
isestimated thatatrial willtake
morethanoneday.Inmany courts
theso-called “short cause” cases
willbescheduled more quickly
than longcause cases, since “short
cause” cases areeasier tofitintobusy court calendars. Ifatrial esti-
mated asa“short cause” turns outto
take longer thanoneday,thejudge
maydeclare amistrial andforce the
parties totrythecase over again
from scratch atalater date asa
“long cause.” (See:calendar call,

loss: n.1)thevalue placed oninjury or
damages due toanaccident caused
byanother’s negligence, abreach of

lossofbargain: n.theinability to
complete asale orother business
deal, caused byanother’s breach of

spouse hasbeen injured andcannot
participate insexual relations fora
period oftime orpermanently dueto
the injury, orsuffers from mental
distress, duetoadefendant’s wrong-
doing, which interferes with usual

therights ofEnglish barons and
major landowners and limiting
theabsolute authority oftheKing

fortherights ofEnglish citizens.
Itwassigned reluctantly byKing
John onJune 15,1215, atRun-
nymede, atatable setupinafield
under acanopy surrounded bythe
armed gentry. TheMagna Carta
was confirmed byJohn’s son,
Henry III,andinturnbyHenry’s
son,Edward I.AsJohn Cowell
would write four centuries later:
“although thischarter consists of
notabove thirty seven Charters or
Lawes yet itisofsuch extent, as
alltheLawweehave, isthought in
some form todepend onit.”Essen-
tially adocument forthenobility,itbecame thebasis ofindividual

mailbox rule: n.incontract law,
making awritten offer oracceptance
ofoffer valid ifsent inthemail, with
postage, within thetime inwhich
the offermust beaccepted, unless
theoffer requires acceptance byper-
sonal delivery onorbefore thespeci-
fieddate.Therulemay alsoapply to
mailing payments ofinsurance pre-
miums when due.However, relying
onthis so-called “rule” canbedan-
gerous, since theparty awaiting the
acceptance orpayment may cancel
theoffer ifthere isnoresponse in
handwhen thetimeruns out.
maim: v.toinflict aserious bodily in-
jury, including mutilation orany
harm which limits thevictim’s abili-
tytofunction physically. Originally,
inEnglish common law itmeant
tocutofforpermanently cripple a

malfeasance: n.intentionally doing
something either legally ormorally
wrong which onehadnoright todo.
Italways involves dishonesty, ille-
gality orknowingly exceeding au-
thority forimproper reasons.
Malfeasance isdistinguished from
“misfeasance,” which iscommitting
awrong orerror bymistake, negli-
gence orinadvertence, butnotbyin-
tentional wrongdoing. Example: a
citymanager putting hisindigent
cousin onthecitypayroll atawage
themanager knows isabove that al-
lowed and/or letting him filefalse
time cards ismalfeasance; putting
hisablecousin onthepayroll which,
unknown tohim, isaviolation ofan
anti-nepotism statute ismisfea-
sance. This distinction canapply to
corporate officers, public officials,trustees andothers cloaked with re-
sponsibility. (See:misfeasance)
malice: n.aconscious, intentional
wrongdoing either ofacivilwrong like
libel (false written statement about
another) oracriminal actlikeassault
ormurder, withtheintention ofdoing
harm tothevictim. This intention in-
cludes ill-will, hatred ortotal disre-
gard fortheother’s well-being. Often
themean nature oftheactitself im-
plies malice, without theparty saying
“Idid itbecause Iwasmad athim,and
Ihated him,” which would beexpress
malice. Malice isanelement infirst
degree murder. Inalawsuit for
defamation (libelandslander) theex-
istence ofmalice may increase the
judgment toinclude general damages.
Proof ofmalice isabsolutely necessary
fora“public figure” towinalawsuit for
defamation. (See:defamation, libel,
malice aforethought, malicious
prosecution, murder, public fig-
ure,slander)
malice aforethought: n.1)thecon-
scious intent tocause death orgreat
bodily harm toanother person before
aperson commits thecrime. Such
malice isarequired element toprove
firstdegree murder. 2)ageneral evil
anddepraved state ofmind inwhich
theperson isunconcerned forthe
lives ofothers. Thus, ifaperson uses
agun toholdupabankandaninno-
centbystander iskilled inashoot-
outwith police, there ismalice afore-
thought. (See: firstdegree murder,
malice, murder)
malicious prosecution: n.filing alaw-
suitwith theintention ofcreating
problems forthedefendant such
ascosts, attorneys’ fees, anguish, or
259

malpractice
distraction when there isnosub-
stantial basis forthesuit. Ifthede-
fendant inthelawsuit winsandhas
evidence thatthesuitwas filedout
ofspiteandwithout anylegal orfac-
tualfoundation, he/she may, inturn,
suefordamages against theperson
who filedtheoriginal action. Ifmal-
ice isclearly proved against the
partywhobrought theoriginal suit,
punitive damages maybeawarded
along with special andgeneral dam-
ages. Inrecent cases, courts have
ruled thatanattorney whoknow-
ingly assists aclient infiling a
worthless lawsuit outofmalice or
spitemay beliable fordamages
along withtheclient. Thesuitbythe
victim torecover damages forama-
licious prosecution cannot befiled
until theoriginal lawsuit isdecided
infavor ofthevictim. (See:malice)
malpractice: n.Anactorcontinuing
conduct ofaprofessional which does
notmeet thestandard ofprofession-
alcompetence andresults inprov-
abledamages tohis/her client orpa-
tient. Such anerror oromission
may bethrough negligence, igno-
rance (when theprofessional should
haveknown), orintentional wrong-
doing. However, malpractice does
notinclude theexercise ofprofes-
sional judgment evenwhen there-
sults aredetrimental totheclient or
patient. Except incases ofextreme-
lyobvious orintentional wrongs, in
order toprove malpractice there
must betestimony ofanexpert asto
theacceptable standard ofcare ap-
plied tothespecific actorconduct
which isclaimed tobemalpractice
andtestimony oftheexpert that
theprofessional didnotmeet that
standard. Thedefendant then canproduce his/her ownexpert tocounter
thattestimony. Professions which are
subject tolawsuits based onclaims of
malpractice include lawyers, physi-
cians, dentists, hospitals, accoun-
tants, architects, engineers and real
estate brokers. Insome states inorder
tofileanaction formalpractice
against amedical caregiver, there
must beawritten demand ornotice
which gives thephysician orhospital
achance tosettle thematter before a
suit isfiled. Inactions against attor-
neys itismandatory thattheplaintiff
prove that the error, ifany,caused
damages. Thismeans thatalawsuit,
claim ornegotiation theattorney was
handling would have resulted inawin
orbetter recovery except forthemal-
practice. Thus, there isarequirement
ofproving theoriginal “case within
thecase” during thetrial ofthemal-
practice claim. Contrary topublic per-
ception, substantial judgments inmal-
practice actions arerare,with studies
showing thatonlyasmall percentage
oftheclaims result inrecovery forthe
allegedly aggrieved client orpatient.
Theprincipal reason isthatmost cries
ofmalpractice areunfounded andare
based onunhappiness with theresult
oftheoriginal services nomatter how
wellhandled, abreakdown incommu-
nication between attorney ordoctor
and client orpatient, anger with the
professional, retaliation forattempts
tocollect unpaid feesorgreed. (See:

Mann Act: n.afederal statute making
261

manslaughter
itacrime totransport awoman
across state lines for“immoral” pur-
poses. TheMann Actwasintended
toprevent themovement ofprosti-
tutesfromonestate toanother orin
andoutofthecountry intheso-
called “white slave” trade. However,
italsoapplies toamale taking his
under-age girlfriend toalove-nest
inaneighboring state, orafemale
transporting anunder-age boy
across thestate line forsuch pur-
poses.Maximum term isfiveyears
inafederal prison.
manslaughter: n.theunlawful
killing ofanother person without
premeditation orso-called “malice
aforethought” (an evilintent prior
tothe killing). Itisdistinguished
frommurder (which brings greater
penalties) bylackofanyprior inten-
tion tokillanyone orcreate adead-
lysituation. There aretwolevels of
manslaughter: voluntary andinvol-
untary. Voluntary manslaughter in-
cludes killing inheat ofpassion or
while committing afelony. Involun-
tarymanslaughter occurs when a
death iscaused byaviolation ofa
non-felony, such asreckless driving
(called ‘Vehicular manslaughter”).
Examples: Eddy Hothead gets into
adrunken argument inasaloon
with hisacquaintance BobBone-
head, andHothead hitsBonehead
over thehead with abeer bottle,
causing internal bleeding and
death. Brent Burgle sneaks intoa
warehouse intent ontheft and is
surprised byasecurity man,whom
Burgle knocks down aflight of
stairs, killing him.Both arevolun-
tary manslaughter. However, if
eithermanhadusedagun, amur-
dercharge ismost likely since hebrought adeadly weapon touseinthe
crime. Theimmediate rage infinding
aloved oneinbedwith another fol-
lowed byakilling before thepassion
cools usually limits thecharge tovol-
untary manslaughter andnotmurder,
but prior attacks could convince a
District Attorney andajurythatthe
killing wasnottotally spontaneous.
Lenny Leadfoot drives 70miles per
hour onatwisting mountain road,
goes offacliffand hispassenger is
killed inthecrash. Leadfoot canbe
charged withinvoluntary manslaugh-
ter.(See:homicide, murder)
marital deduction: n.anestate tax
deduction allowed asurviving spouse

value oftheestate before there isa
possible federal estate taxrisesfrom
$600,000 (the levelwhere estate tax
begins tobecalculated andcharged)
to$1,200,000 atthedeath ofthefirst
spouse todie.Intrusts which amar-
riedcouple creates, theycanagree
thatonthedeath ofthe first togo,
theamount oftheproperty which is
given tothesurvivor islimited tothe
amount which willnotbesubject to
federal estate tax,thus delaying
some orallestate taxuntil thedeath
ofthesurviving spouse. Such trust
provisions should bewritten onlyby
anattorney andwith consultation
withanaccountant orfinancial ad-
viser. (See:community property,
estate tax,trust)
marital rights: n.anold-fashioned ex-

oftime without legal formalities.
(See:common law-marriage)
marshal: 1)n.afederal court official
whomayserve papers andactasa
lawenforcement officer inkeeping
order incourt, protecting federal of-
ficials, making arrests orparticipat-
ingincourt-ordered police activi-
ties.Each district court hasafeder-

martial law: n.asystem ofcomplete
control byacountry’s military over
allactivities, including civilian, in
atheoretical oractual war zone,
orduring aperiod ofemergency
caused byadisaster such asan
earthquake orflood, with themili-
tarycommander having dictatorial
powers. IntheUnited States mar-
tiallawmust beordered bythe
President ascommander-in-chief
andmust belimited totheduration
ofthewarfare oremergency. Itcan-
notresult inalong-term denial ofconstitutional rights, such ashabeas
corpus, theright toatrial,andtofree
press. Martial lawwasordered incon-
tested areas during theCivilWar(but
theSupreme Court ruled President
Abraham Lincoln’s suspension ofthe
writofhabeas corpus wasunconstitu-
tional), andduring theSanFrancisco
earthquake and firein1906when the
citywas inruins, tens ofthousands
were homeless, and looting and dis-
easeposed great dangers tothepublic.
Misuse ofmartial law,such asde-
struction oftheveterans’ encampment
inWashington, D.C.under President
Herbert Hoover, hasproved unpopu-
larintheUnited States. Inmany for-
eigncountries martial lawhasbecome
amethod toestablish andmaintain
dictatorships either bymilitary lead-
ersorpoliticians backed bythemili-
tary.Martial law isnottobeconfused
with “military law,”which governs the
conduct ofthemilitary services and
applies only toservice men and
women. (See:military law)
Massachusetts Trust: n.abusiness
inwhich theinvestors givemanage-
ment authority toatrustee and re-
ceive “trust certificates” representing
their investments. Since theyown
onlythecertificates anddonotpar-
ticipate inmanagement, the in-
vestors canonly lose their invest-
mentandarenotpersonally liable for
anydebts ofthetrust. This issimilar
toa“limited partnership.” AMassa-
chusetts Trust isstrictly abusiness
entity andbears norelationship toa

mentary trusts setuptomanage and
protect theassets ofindividuals and
provide foreventual distribution.
master: n.1)employer, inthearea of
264

maxims
lawknown as“master and ser-
vant,” which more properly should
becalled employer andemployee.
2)aperson, supposedly with spe-
cialexpertise, appointed byajudge
toinvestigate aproblem (such as
whether aparent’s home isappro-
priate forchild visitation) and re-
portback tothejudge his/her find-
ingsandrecommendations. (See:
employment, master and ser-
vant, respondeat superior )
master andservant: n.thebody of
law,including statutes and legal
decisions which areprecedents,
which relates totherelationship
ofanemployer andemployee. (See:

material: adj.relevant and signifi-
cant. Inalawsuit, “material evi-
dence” isdistinguished from total-
lyirrelevant orofsuchminor im-
portance thatthecourt willeither
ignore it,rule itimmaterial ifob-
jected to,ornotallow lengthy tes-
timony upon suchamatter.A“ma-
terial breach” ofacontract isa
valid excuse bytheother party not
toperform. However, aninsignifi-
cantdivergence from theterms of
thecontract isnotamaterial
breach.
material representation: n.acon-
vincing statement made toinduce
someone toenter intoacontract to
which theperson would nothave
agreed without that assertion.
Thus, ifthematerial representa-
tionproves nottobetrue ortobe
misleading, thecontract canbere-
scinded orcancelled without liabil-
ity.(See: contract, material)material witness: n.aperson whoap-
parently hasinformation about the
subject matter ofalawsuit orcriminal
prosecution which issignificant
enough toaffect theoutcome ofthe
case ortrial. Thus, thecourt must
make every reasonable effort toallow
such awitness totestify, including a
continuance (delay inatrial) toac-
commodate him/her iflate ortem-
porarily unavailable. (See: material,
trial, witness)
matter ofrecord: n.anything, includ-
ingtestimony, evidence, rulings and
sometimes arguments, which has
been recorded bythecourt reporter or
court clerk. Itisanexpression often
heard intrials and legalarguments
that “such andsuch isamatter of
record” asdistinguished from actions
outside thecourt ordiscussions not
written down ortaped.
maturity: n.1)thedatewhen thepay-
ment oftheprincipal amount owed
under theterms ofapromissory note
orbillofexchange becomes due.
Quite oftenanote states that failure
topayinterest orinstallment pay-
ments when due “accelerates” the
note,making the“maturity date” im-
mediate ifsuchpayments arede-
manded and notpaid. 2)theage
when onebecomes anadult, which is
18formost purposes. (See: acceler-
ation, billofexchange, legal age,
promissory note)
maxims: n.acollection oflegaltruisms
which areused as“rules ofthumb” by
bothjudges and lawyers. They are
listed inthecodified statutes ofmost
states, andinclude:
“When thereason ofarule ceases, so
should therule itself.”

may: v.achoice toactornot,ora
promise ofapossibility, asdistin-
guished from “shall,” which makes
itimperative. 2)instatutes, and
sometimes incontracts, theword
“may” must beread incontext tode-
termine ifitmeans anactisoption-
alormandatory, foritmaybeanim-
perative. Thesame careful analysis
must bemade oftheword “shall.”Non-lawyers tend toseetheword
“may” andthink theyhaveachoice or

some statutory provision orregula-
tion. (See: shall)
mayhem: 1)n.thecriminal actofdis-
abling, disfiguring orcutting offor
making useless oneofthemembers
(leg,arm, hand, foot, eye)ofanother
either intentionally orinafight,
called maiming. Theserious nature of
theinjury makes mayhem afelony,
which iscalled “aggravated assault”
inmost states. 2)v.tocommit may-
hem istocause grossharm inanun-
controlled fashion. (See:aggravated

McNabb-Mallory rule: n.afederal
ruleofevidence incriminal trials that
prohibits theuseofincriminating
statements made byadefendant while
he/she isdetained beyond thelegal pe-
riodoftime before being brought be-
foreajudge ormagistrate (arraign-
ment). This rule isseldom applied
since thecourts havebecome zealous
about speedy arraignments andwarn-
ings totheaccused about theright to
remain silent andhave alawyer pre-
sent. (See:Miranda warning)
mechanic’s lien: n.theright ofa
craftsman, laborer, supplier, architect
orother person whohasworked upon
improvements ordelivered materials

alcontractor hasbeentardy inmak-
ingpayment), limits ontheamount
collectable insome states, andvari-
oustime limitations toenforce the
lien. Ultimate, last-resort enforce-
ment ofthemechanic’s lien isac-
complished byfiling alawsuit to
foreclose thelienandhave theprop-
ertysoldinorder tobepaid. Proper-
tyowners should make sure that
their general contractors paytheir
employees orsubcontractors to
avoid amechanic’s lien, since the
owner could beforced topaythe
debts ofageneral contractor even
though theowner hasalready paid
thecontractor. Iftheworker orsup-
plierdoesnotsuetoenforce theme-
chanic’s lien,he/shemay stillsuefor

mediation: n.theattempt tosettle a
legal dispute through active partic-
ipation ofathird party (mediator)
whoworks tofindpoints ofagree-
ment andmake those inconflict
agree onafair result. Mediation
differs from arbitration, inwhich
thethird party (arbitrator) acts
much likeajudge inanout-of-
court, lessformal setting butdoes
notactively participate inthedis-
cussion. Mediation hasbecome very
common intrying toresolve domes-
ticrelations disputes (divorce, child
custody, visitation) and isoften or-
dered bythejudge insuch cases.
Mediation alsohasbecome more
frequent incontract and civildam-
age cases. There areprofessional
mediators orlawyers whodosome
mediation forsubstantial fees,but
thefinancial cost islessthan fight-
ingthematter outincourtandmay
achieve early settlement andanend toanxiety. However, mediation
does notalways result inasettle-
ment. (See:arbitration)
mediator: n.aperson whoconducts me-
diation.Amediator isusually alawyer
orretired judge butcanbeanon-at-
torney specialist inthesubject matter
(like child custody) who tries tobring
people andtheir disputes toearly res-
olution through aconference. Theme-
diator isanactive participant inthe
discussions andattempts towork outa
solution, unlike anarbitrator, who sits
asajudge. (See: arbitration, arbi-
trator, mediation)
meetandconfer: n.arequirement of
courts thatbefore certain types ofmo-
tions and/or petitions willbeheard by
thejudge, thelawyers (andsometimes
their clients) must “meet andconfer”
totrytoresolve thematter oratleast
determine thepoints ofconflict. This
hasthebeneficial effect ofresolving
many matters, reducing thetime for
arguments andmaking thelawyers
and clients faceuptotherealities of
their positions. Ontheother hand, it
alsocanbeatotalwaste oftime forthe
parties andtheir attorneys. Themeet
andconfer rule isparticularly common
(and useful) indomestic relations dis-
putes overtemporary support, custody,
visitation andsuch issues which are
freighted withemotion.
meeting oftheminds: n.when two
parties toanagreement (contract)
bothhave thesame understanding of
theterms oftheagreement. Such
mutual comprehension isessential
toavalid contract. Itisprovable

memorandum: n.1)abrief writing,
note,summary oroutline. 2)A
“memorandum ofdecision,” or
“memorandum opinion,” isabrief
statement byajudge announcing
his/her ruling without detail or
giving extensive reasons, which
may ormay notbefollowed bya
more comprehensive written deci-
sion.Suchmemoranda (plural) are
issued byappeals courts inlan-
guage such as:“The petition ofap-
pellant isdenied forthereasons
stated inAlbini v.Younger” or
“The decision below isaffirmed.”
mens rea:(menz ray-ah) n.Latin
fora“guilty mind,” orcriminal in-
tent incommitting the act. (See:
crime, intent)
mental anguish: n.mental suffering
which includes fright, feelings of
distress, anxiety, depression, grief
and/or psychosomatic physical
symptoms. Itisdistinguished from
physical painduetoaninjury, but it
may beconsidered inawarding
damages forphysical injury duetoa
defendant’s negligence orintention-
alinfliction ofharm. Where there is
nophysical injury, damages can still
beawarded formental anguish ifit
isreasonable topresume such
would naturally flowfrom theinci-
dent. Examples: holding apistol to
one’s head, any threat ofbodily
harmwhen itappears itcould becarried out,swinging with ascythe
eventhough theassailant missed, or
witnessing injury ordeath toaloved
one.There arealso situations in
which theobvious result ofthealleged
wrongdoing would bemental distress
due toembarrassment ordamage to
one’s reputation through libel, and
therefore damages canbeawarded to
thedistressed party. However, there
arelimits: ingeneral, breach ofcon-
tractjudgments cannot include dam-
ages formental anguish due tothe
lossofadealoremployment. Butthen
there isthecase oftheshopwhich
failed todeliver thebridal gown in
time forthewedding—mental an-
guish flows naturally (along with the
bride’s tears) fromsuchabreach. (See:
damages, mental suffering)

mental cruelty: n.aterm, rapidly
going outoffashion andoutofthe
statutes, which hasbeenused tojus-
tifygranting adivorce when thestate
laws required thatsomewrong had
tobefound inthedefending spouse.
Inabsence ofactual physical cruelty
(orunwillingness todiscuss it)the

testify toalistofindignities (“he
swore atme,hecamehome late,he
humiliated meinfront offriends,
hewas hateful tomymother, he

tales toldabout thewife) which
would beverified byarelative ora
friend tosatisfy thejudge thatthe
petitioning spouse would suffer
mental harm ifthemarriage con-
tinued andproved thatthere were
grounds foradivorce. As“no-fault”
divorce hasgained favor, such cha-
rades have faded intolegal history.
(See: cruelty, divorce)
mental suffering: n.emotional pain
synonymous with“mental anguish.”
(See:mental anguish)
mercantile law: n.thatbroad areaof
thelaw (also called commercial
law), statutes, cases andcustoms

taminated orflawed. (See: sale)
merger: n.1)incorporate law,thejoining together oftwocorporations in
which onecorporation transfers Mlof
itsassets totheother, which continues
toexist. Ineffect onecorporation
“swallows” theother, buttheshare-
holders oftheswallowed company re-
ceive shares ofthesurviving corpora-
tion.Amerger isdistinguished froma
“consolidation,” inwhich bothcompa-
niesjointogether tocreate anew cor-
poration. 2)inrealproperty law,when
anowner ofaninterest inproperty ac-
quires agreater orlesser interest in
thesame property, thetwointerests
become one.Examples: aperson with
alifeestate isgiven the title tothe
property byinheritance, the lifeestate
ismerged with thetitled interest. 3)
another important form ofmerger oc-
curswhen aperson acquires two
parcels oflandwhich were onceasin-
glelotthathadbeen divided intotwo
lotsbya“lotsplit” granted bythecity
orcounty. Iftheminimum lotsizehas
been increased bychanges inlocal or-
dinances andthetwo lotsarenow
sub-standard size, thebuyerwho ac-
quires title inthetwo lotsmay find
thatthey are“merged” intoone lot
andheorshehas losttheright to
build ahouse oneach lot.Tbavoid this
problem, thebuyer should make sure
titleineach lotisobtained under adif-
ferent name, i.e.husband taking one,
andwifetheother.
mesne: (mean, with asilent s)adj.from
Norman French forintermediate, the

ofaparcel ofreal property, using
carefully measured distances, an-
glesand directions, which results
inwhat iscalled a“legal descrip-

country whoarenotCaucasian, such
astheUnited States where Cau-
casians comprise themajority andthe
minorities include African Americans,
Hispanics, Asians, indigenous Ameri-
cans (Indians) and other so-called
“people ofcolor.” This ironic term is
used despite thefactthatthemajority
oftheworld’s population isnotCau-
casian. Sometimes theterm isem-
ployed toinclude women andhomo-
sexuals. “Minority” carries with ita
certain patronizing toneevenwhen
used toassert rights ofpeoples who
havebeen discriminated against, ei-
ther socially orbylaw. 3)theperiod of

Miranda warning: n.therequire-
ment, alsocalled theMiranda rule, set
bytheU.S.Supreme Court inMiran-
da v.Arizona (1966) that prior tothe

theaccused person confesses tothe
authorities, theprosecution must
prove tothejudge that thedefen-
dantwasinformed ofthese rights
andknowingly waived them, before
theconfession canbeintroduced in
thedefendant’s criminal trial.The
Miranda rulesupposedly prevents

cannot distinguish between right
andwrong inregard tothecrime

mortgage: n.adocument inwhich
theowner pledges his/her/its title to
realproperty toalender assecurity
foraloandescribed inapromissory
note. Mortgage isanoldEnglish
term derived from twoFrench
words “mort” and“gage” meaning
“dead pledge.” Tobeenforceable the
mortgage must besigned bythe
owner (borrower), acknowledged be-
foreanotary public, andrecorded
with theCounty Recorder or
Recorder ofDeeds. Iftheowner
(mortgagor) fails tomake payments
onthepromissory note (becomes
delinquent) then thelender (mort-
gagee) can foreclose onthemort-
gage toforce asaleoftherealprop-
erty toobtain payment from the
proceeds, orobtain theproperty it-
selfatasheriff’s saleupon foreclo-
sure.However, catching upondelin-
quent payments andpaying costs of
foreclosure (“curing the default”)
cansave theproperty. Insome
states theproperty canberedeemed
bysuchpayment even after foreclo-
sure.Upon payment infullthe
mortgagee (lender) isrequired toex-
ecute a“satisfaction ofmortgage”
(sometimes called a“discharge of
mortgage”) andrecord ittoclear the
title totheproperty. Apurchase-
money mortgage isonegiven by
apurchaser toaseller ofrealprop-
erty aspartial payment. Amort-
gagormay selltheproperty either
“subject toamortgage” inwhich theproperty isstillsecurity andtheseller
isstillliable forpayment, orthebuyer
“assumes themortgage” andbecomes
personally responsible forpayment of
theloan.Under English common law
amortgage wasanactual transfer of
title tothelender, with theborrower
having theright tooccupy theproper-
tywhile itwasineffect, butnon-pay-
ment ended theright ofoccupation.
Today only Connecticut, Maine, New
Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Is-
landandVermont cling tothecom-
mon law,andother states using mort-
gages treatthem asliensontheprop-
erty.More significantly, 14states use
a“deed oftrust” (or“trust deed”) asa
mortgage. These states include: Cali-
fornia, Illinois, Texas, Virginia, Col-
orado, Georgia, Alaska, Arizona,
Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Mon-
tana, North Carolina andWest Vir-
ginia.Under thedeed oftrustsystem
title istechnically given toatrustee to
hold forthelender, who iscalled a
beneficiary. (See:deed oftrust, fore-
closure, judicial foreclosure, no-

motion foranew trial
modification ofanorder, fortempo-
rary child support, forajudgment,
fordismissal oftheopposing party’s
case, forarehearing, forsanctions
(payment ofthemoving party’s costs
orattorney’s fees), orfordozens of
other purposes. Most motions re-
quire awritten petition, awritten
brief oflegal reasons forgranting
themotion (often called “points and
authorities”), written notice tothe
attorney fortheopposing party and
ahearing before ajudge. However,
during atrial orahearing, anoral
motion maybepermitted.
motion foranew trial: n.are-
quest made bytheloser forthe
case tobetried again onthebasis
that there were significant legal
errors inthewaythetrialwascon-
ducted and/or thejuryorthejudge
sitting without ajury obviously
came toanincorrect result. This
motion must bemade within afew
days after thejudgment isformal-
lyentered and isusually heard by
thesame judge who presided at
the trial.Such amotion isseldom
granted (particularly ifthejudge
heard thecasewithout ajury) un-
lessthere issome very clear error
which anyjudge would recognize.
Some lawyers feel themotion
helps add totherecord ofargu-
ment leading toanappeal ofthe
case toanappeals court. (See:
judgment notwithstanding the
verdict, motion, N.O.V.)
motion fordismissal (non-suit):
n.application byadefendant ina
lawsuit orcriminal prosecution
asking thejudge torulethat the
plaintiff (thepartywho filed the
lawsuit) ortheprosecution hasnotandcannot prove itscase. Attorneys
most oftenmake thismotion after
theplaintiff orprosecutor haspre-
sented alltheevidence they have,
buttheycanmake itattheendof
theevidence presentation butbefore
judgment orupon evidence being
presented that proves tothejudge
that thedefendant cannot lose.
Quite often this isanoralmotion,
andarguments aremade inthe
judge’s chambers where thejurycan-
nothear. Itisalsosometimes called
amotion fornonsuit. (See:motion)
motion forasummary judgment: n.
awritten request forajudgment in
themoving party’s favor before alaw-
suitgoes totrialandbased ontesti-
mony recorded outside court, affi-
davits (declarations under penalty of
peijury), depositions, admissions of
factand/or answers towritten inter-
rogatories, claiming that allfactual
andlegal issues canbedecided inthe
moving party’s favor. These alleged
facts areaccompanied byawritten
legal brief (points andauthorities) in
support ofthemotion. Theopposing
party needs toshow byaffidavits,
written declarations orpoints andau-
thorities (written legalargument in
support ofthemotion) thatthere are
“triable issues offact”and/or oflawby
points and authorities. Ifthere are
anytriable issues themotion must be
denied andthecasecangototrial.
Sometimes, ifthere areseveral claims
(causes ofaction) such amotion may
cause thejudge tofind (decide) that
some causes ofaction canbedecided
under themotion, leaving fewer mat-
tersactually tobetried. Thepaper-
work onboth sides iscomplex, bur-
densome andinmany states, based on
strict procedures. (See:motion)

motion inlimine:
(lim-in-nay) n.
Latin for“threshold,” amotion
made atthestart ofatrialrequest-
ingthatthejudge rulethatcertain
evidence maynotbeintroduced in
trial. This ismostcommon incrimi-
naltrials where evidence issubject
toconstitutional limitations, such
asstatements made without theMi-
randa warnings (reading thesus-
pecthis/her rights). (See:inlimine,
Miranda warning, motion)
motion tostrike: n.arequest fora
judge’s order toeliminate allora
portion ofthelegal pleading (com-
plaint, answer) oftheopposition on
anyoneofseveral grounds. Itis
often used inanattempt tohavean
entire cause ofaction removed
(“stricken”) from thecourt record.A
motion tostrike isalsomade orally
during trial toaskthejudge toorder
“stricken” answers byawitness in
violation ofrules ofevidence (laws
covering what isadmissible intrial).
Eventhough thejury isadmonished
toignore suchananswer orsome
comment, thejuryhasheard it,and
“abellonce rung, cannot beun-
rung.” (See:motion, strike)
motion tosuppress: n.amotion
(usually onbehalf ofacriminal de-
fendant) todisallow certain evi-
dence inanupcoming trial.Exam-
ple:aconfession which thedefen-
dant alleges wassigned while he
wasdrunk orwithout thereading
ofhisMiranda rights. Since the
motion ismade atthethreshold of
the trial, itisamotion inlimine,
which isLatin for“atthethresh-
old.” (See:motion inlimine)
motive: n.incriminal investigationtheprobable reason aperson com-
mitted acrime, such asjealousy,
greed, revenge orpart ofatheft.
While evidence ofamotive maybe
admissible attrial, proof ofmotive is
notnecessary toprove acrime.

forone’s lawyer.
movant: n.theparty inalawsuit or
other legal proceeding whomakes a
motion (application foracourt order
orjudgment). (See:motion, move)

multifarious: adj., adv.reference toa
lawsuit inwhich either party orvar-
iouscauses ofaction (claims based
ondifferent legal theories) areim-
properly joined together inthesame
suit.This ismorecommonly called
misjoinder. (See:misjoinder)
multiplicity ofsuits: n.several actu-
alorpotential lawsuits which should
bejoined together inone suitand
one trial. Itisabasic principle oflaw
that multiplicity istobeavoided
when possible, practical and fair.Ex-
ample: several suits arefiledbydif-

muniment oftitle
demeanors and civil lawsuits in-
volving lesser amounts ofmoney
than superior, district orcounty
courts. The authority, importance
andgeographical areacovered dif-
ferfrom state tostate. InCalifor-
nia,municipal courts have county-
wide jurisdiction, trymisdemeanor
criminal cases, conduct prelimi-
nary hearings offelonies and try
casesupto$25,000, while inmany
states theyonlyhandle cases aris-
ingoutofviolations ofcity ordi-
nances, traffic and/or small claims.
(See: court)
muniment oftitle: n.documentary
evidence oftitle toreal property. A
muniment could beadeed, adecree
ofdistribution proving inheritance,
oracontract ofsale. (See: deed,
quiet titleaction, title)
murder: n.thekilling ofahuman
being byasane person, with intent,
malice aforethought (prior inten-
tion tokilltheparticular victim or
anyone who gets intheway)and
withnolegal excuse orauthority.
Inthose clear circumstances, this
isfirstdegree murder. Bystatute,
many states consider akilling in
which there istorture, movement
oftheperson before the killing
(kidnapping) orthedeath ofapo-
lice officer orprison guard, orit
wasasanincident toanother crime
(asduring ahold-up orrape), tobe
firstdegree murder, with orwith-
outpremeditation andwith malice
presumed. Second degree murder
issuch akilling without premedi-
tation, asintheheat ofpassion or
inasudden quarrel orfight. Malice
insecond degree murder maybe
implied from adeath due tothereckless lackofconcern forthe lifeof
others (such asfiring agun into a
crowd orbashing someone withany
deadly weapon). Depending onthe
circumstances and state laws, mur-
derinthefirstorsecond degree may
bechargeable toaperson whodidnot
actually kill,butwasinvolved ina
crime with apartner who actually
didthekilling orsomeone diedasthe
result ofthecrime. Example: Ina
liquor store stick-up inwhich the
clerk shoots back atthehold-up man
and killsabystander, thearmed rob-
bercanbeconvicted ofatleast sec-
onddegree murder. Acharge ofmur-
derrequires thatthevictim must die
within ayear oftheattack. Death of
anunborn childwho is“quick” (fetus
ismoving) canbemurder, provided
therewaspremeditation, malice and
nolegal authority. Thus, abortion is
notmurder under thelaw.Example:
Jack Violent shoots hispregnant girl-
friend, killing thefetus. Manslaugh-
ter,both voluntary andinvoluntary,
lacks theelement ofmalice afore-
thought. (See: firstdegree murder,
homicide, malice aforethought,
manslaughter, premeditation,
second degree murder)
mutual: adj., adv.referring toanything
inwhich both parties have reciprocal
rights, understanding oragreement.
mutual wills: n.willsmade bytwopeo-
ple(usually spouses, butcould be
“partners”) inwhich each gives his/her
estate totheother, orwith dispositions
theyboth agree upon.Alaterchange
byeither isnotinvalid unless itcanbe
proved that there wasacontract in
which eachmakes thewillinthecon-
sideration fortheother person making

National Labor Relations Board:
n.anindependent regulatory com-
mission created in1935bytheNa-
tional Labor Relations Act(Wagner
Act), with fivemembers appointed
bythePresident subject toconfir-
mation bytheSenate. TheNLRB is
intended toprotect employees’
rights tounionize, prevent abuses
byemployers orunions, andoversee
union andorganizing elections.
natural law: n.1)standards ofcon-
ductderived from traditional moral
principles (first mentioned by
Roman jurists inthe firstcentury
A.D.) and/or God’s lawand will.The
biblical tencommandments, suchas
“thou shall not kill,” areoften in-
cluded inthose principles. Natural
lawassumes that allpeople believe
inthesame Judeo-Christian God
andthusshare anunderstanding of
natural lawpremises. 2)thebody of
laws derived from nature andrea-
son,embodied intheDeclaration of
Independence assertion that “all
menarecreated equal, thattheyare
endowed bytheir creator with cer-
taininalienable Rights, thatamong
these areLife, Liberty andthepur-
suitofhappiness.” 3)theopposite of
“positive law,”which iscreated by
mankind through thestate.
natural person: n.arealhuman
being, asdistinguished from acor-
poration, which isoften treated at
lawasafictitious person.mean convenient, useful ormaking
good sense.
necessary inference: n.1)aconclu-
sion militated byreason and logic
applied toknown facts. 2)unavoid-
ablemeaning.
necessary party: n.aperson orentity
whose interests willbeaffected bythe
outcome ofalawsuit, whose absence
asaparty inthesuitprevents ajudg-
mentonallissues, butwhocannot be
joined inthelawsuit because that
would deny jurisdiction totheparticu-
larcourt (such asshifting jurisdiction
fromastate tofederal court). Inthis
rare technical situation, anecessary
partywho isnotinthesuitdiffers from
an“indispensable party,” whomust be
joined ifthelawsuit istoproceed, and
from a“proper party,” whocould be
joined but isnotessential. (See: indis-
pensable party, proper party)

negligence
allegation inwhich aperson actu-
allyadmits more than he/she de-
niesbydenying onlyapart ofthe
alleged fact.Example: Plaintiff al-
leges Defendant “misused more
than ahundred thousand dollars
placed inhistrust in1994.” Defen-
dant denies theamount wasmore
than ahundred thousand, andde-
nies itwasgiven tohim in1994.
Thus, hedidnotdeny themisuse,
justtheamount andthedate.
negligence: n.failure toexercise
thecaretoward others which a
reasonable orprudent person
would dointhecircumstances, or
taking action which suchareason-
ableperson would not.Negligence
isaccidental asdistinguished from
“intentional torts” (assault ortres-
pass, forexample) orfrom crimes,
butacrime can also constitute
negligence, such asreckless dri-
ving. Negligence canresult inall
types ofaccidents causing physical
and/or property damage, butcan
also include business errors and
miscalculations, such asasloppy
land survey. Inmaking aclaim for
damages based onanallegation of
another’s negligence, theinjured
party (plaintiff) must prove: a)
thattheparty alleged tobenegli-
genthadaduty totheinjured
party—specifically totheone in-
jured ortothegeneral public, b)
thatthedefendant’s action (orfail-
ure toact)was negligent—not
what areasonably prudent person
would have done, c)thatthedam-
ages were caused (“proximately
caused”) bythenegligence. An
added factor intheformula forde-
termining negligence iswhether
thedamages were “reasonablyforeseeable” atthetime ofthe al-
leged carelessness. Iftheinjury is
caused bysomething owned orcon-
trolled bythesupposedly negligent
party, buthowtheaccident actually
occurred isnotknown (likeatonof
bricks fallsfrom aconstruction job),
negligence canbefound based onthe
doctrine ofresipsa loquitor (Latin
for“thething speaks foritself”). Fur-
thermore, insixstates (Alabama,
North Carolina, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland) and
theDistrict ofColumbia, aninjured
party willbedenied anyjudgment
(payment) iffound tohave been
guilty ofeven slight “contributory
negligence” intheaccident. This ar-
chaic andunfair rulehasbeen re-
placed by“comparative negligence”
intheother 44states, inwhich the

nocontest: n.incriminal law,ade-
fendant’s plea incourt that he/she
willnotcontest thecharge ofapar-
ticular crime, also called nolo con-
tendere. While technically notanad-
mission ofguilt forcommission of
thecrime, thejudge willtreataplea
of“nocontest” assuchanadmission
andproceed tofindthedefendant
guilty ascharged. A“nocontest” plea
isoftenmade incases inwhich there
isalsoapossible lawsuit fordam-
agesbyaperson injured bythecrim-
inalconduct (such asreckless dri-
ving, assault with adeadly weapon,
aggravated assault), because itcan-
notbeused inthecivillawsuit asan
admission offault. “Nocontest” is
alsousedwhere there hasbeen a
“plea bargain” inwhich thedefen-
dantdoesnotwant tosayhe/she is
guilty butaccepts thesentencerecommended bytheprosecutor inex-
change fornotcontesting thecharge
(which isoften reduced toalesser
crime). Itisstandard practice forthe
judge toaskeither theattorneys orthe
defendant, “Isthere afactual basis for
theplea?” before accepting itandfind-
ingthedefendant guilty. (See: nolo

nofault insurance: n:atypeofauto-
mobile insurance required ofcar
owners bylaw in19states (New
York, Michigan, Massachusetts,
Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii,
Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Min-
nesota, New Jersey, North Dakota,
Oregon, South Carolina, South Dako-
ta)andtheDistrict ofColumbia, in
which thepersons injured inanacci-
dent arepaid basicdamages bythe
company thatinsured thevehicle in
which theywere riding orbywhich
theywere hitasapedestrian. The
amount ofdamages tobepaidbythe
insurance islimited toactual medical
and rehabilitation expenses, lost
wages andnecessary expenses (such
aslossofuseofthevehicle) with a
lowmaximum andforalimited peri-
od.Inaddition, aninjured person can
suethenegligent driver formedical
costs above theamount oftheinsur-
ance, painand suffering ifthe in-
juries required medical treatment or
resulted inpermanent injury, broken
bones ordisfigurement, orwrongful
death. Allregistered automobiles
must beinsured. Thebenefits ofno
fault include rapid payment ofall
medical expenses inmost cases; elim-
ination oflawsuits except incases in-
volving lesser injuries, very serious
injury ordeath; andelimination of
extensive and costly investigation,

proof ofnegligence, medical reports
anddepositions. Thestatutes vary
instates requiring “nofault” insur-
ance. There havebeen legal chal-
lenges tothestatutes, primarily
suggesting that limitations onthe
right tosueorestablishment of
narrow categories ofinjury for
which aclaim of“pain and suffer-
ing”maybeincluded inalawsuit
areunconstitutional. State courts
have struck down those restric-
tionswhich were arbitrary orpre-
vented legitimate claims. Thefight
overnofault insurance laws con-
tinues state bystate, with thein-
surance companies andsome court
reform advocates (who believe “no
fault” alleviates aclogging ofthe
courts) favoring it,and trial attor-
neys either opposing theproposal
outright orwanting muchmore lee-
way forfiling lawsuits. (See: disso-
lution ofmarriage, negligence)
nofault divorce: n.divorces (disso-
lutions) inwhich neither spouse is
required toprove “fault” ormarital
misconduct onthepart ofthe
other. Toobtain adivorce aspouse
must merely assert incompatibility
or irreconcilable differences,
meaning themarriage has irre-
trievably broken down. This
means there isnodefense toadi-
vorce petition (soaspouse cannot
threaten to“fight” adivorce), there
isnoderogatory testimony, and
marital misconduct cannot beused
toachieve adivision ofproperty fa-
vorable tothe“innocent” spouse.
Increasingly popular since the
1960s, nofault divorce isineffect
inevery state except Illinois and
South Dakota. (See: dissolution
ofmarriage, divorce)nolle prosequi: (no-lay pro-say-kwee)
n.Latin for“weshallnolonger pros-
ecute,” which isadeclaration made
tothejudge byaprosecutor inacrim-
inalcase (orbyaplaintiff inacivil
lawsuit) either before orduring trial,
meaning thecaseagainst thedefen-
dant isbeing dropped. Thestatement
isanadmission thatthecharges can-
notbeproved, that evidence has
demonstrated either innocence ora
fatal flaw intheprosecution’s claim
orthedistrict attorney hasbecome
convinced theaccused isinnocent.
Understandably, usage ofthephrase
israre. Inthe1947courtroom movie,
Boomerang !theclimactic moment ar-
rived when theDistrict Attorney
himself proved theaccused person in-
nocent anddeclared nolle prosequi.
nolo contendere: (no-low kahn-ten-
durr-ray) n.Latin for“Iwillnotcon-
test” thecharges, which isaplea
made byadefendant toacriminal

findhim/her guilty, often called a
“plea ofnocontest.” (See:nocontest)
nominal damages: n.asmallamount
ofmoney awarded toaplaintiff ina
lawsuit toshow he/she wasright but
suffered nosubstantial harm. The
most famous case ofnominal dam-
ageswaswhen Prime Minister Win-
stonChurchill wasawarded ashilling
(about 25cents) inalibellawsuit he
hadbrought against author Louis

terial, incompetent (often stated to-
gether, whichmaymean thequestion
isnotabout theissues inthetrial or
thewitness isnotqualified toanswer),
hearsay (theanswer would bewhat
someone toldthewitness rather than
what he/she knew first-hand), leading
(putting words inthemouth ofone’s
own witness), calls foraconclusion
(asking foropinion, not facts), com-
pound question (two ormore questions
asked together), orlackoffoundation
(referring toadocument lacking testi-
mony astoauthenticity orsource). An
objection must bemade quickly and
loudly tohalt thewitness before
he/she answers. Thejudge willeither
“sustain” theobjection (ruling outthe
question) or“overrule” it(allow the
question). Thejudgemayask foran

asking thequestion must explain to
thecourt thereason thequestion is
relevant, andwhat evidence his/her
questions will bring out.Badly
worded, confusing orcompound
questions areusually challenged by
anobjection totheform oftheques-
tion,which isessentially ademand
thatthequestion bewithdrawn and
reworded. Anattorney may “object”
toawitness’s answer as“non-re-
sponsive” tothequestion, butthe
proper request should bethat the
answer oracomment without a
question be“stricken” from the
record. (See:compound question,

suitinwhich allthelegal issues are
identical (orsoclose astomake nodif-
ference) toanother case, particularly
anappeals decision which isaprece-

Steele v.Merritt is“on allfours” with
thecase before thecourt, andsothe
courtmust reach thesame conclusion.
(See:precedent)
ondemand: adj.inapromissory note,

onthemerits: adj. referring toa
judgment, decision orruling ofa
court based upon thefacts present-
edinevidence andthelawapplied
tothat evidence. Ajudge decides a
case “onthemerits” when he/she
bases thedecision onthefunda-
mental issues andconsiders techni-
calandprocedural defenses asei-
ther inconsequential orovercome.
Example: Anattorney istwodays
late infiling asetoflegal points
andauthorities inopposition toa
motion todismiss. Rather than dis-
miss thecasebased onthistechni-
calprocedural deficiency, thejudge
considers thecase “onthemerits”
asifthismistake hadnotoccurred.

proceedings (trials, hearings and
routine matters such astrial set-

bers (“incamera”) orwiththecourt-
room cleared ofnon-participants
and/or thejurysuch asadoptions,
sanity hearings, juvenile criminalcharges andarguments overevidence
andmotions which might prejudice
thejury.TheSixthAmendment tothe
Constitution, later applied tothe
states under the14thAmendment,
guarantees criminal defendants a
“public trial,” soallcriminal proceed-
ings areheld in“open court.” This
does notapply topre-trial negotia-
tionsandprocedural andmotion dis-
cussions with thejudge, which are
usually held inchambers.
opening statement: n.theexplanation
bytheattorneys forboth sides atthe
beginning ofthetrial ofwhat willbe
proved during the trial.The defen-
dant’s attorney maydelay theopening
statement forthedefense until the
plaintiff’s evidence hasbeen intro-
duced. Unlike a“closing argument,”
theopening statement issupposed to
beafactual presentation andnotan
argument. (See:closing argument)
operation oflaw: n.achange ortrans-
ferwhich occurs automatically dueto
existing lawsandnotanagreement or
court order. Examples: ajoint tenant
obtains fulltitletorealproperty when
theother jointtenant dies;aspouse in
acommunity property state willtake
title toallcommunity property ifthe
spouse dieswithout awillthatleaves
some ofthedead mate’s interest inthe
community property toanother; ora
guardianship ofaminor adlitem (for
purposes ofalawsuit) ends automati-
callyupon thechild turning 18.
opinion: n.theexplanation ofa
court’s judgment. When atrial court
judgment isappealed toacourt of
appeals, theappeals judge’s opinion
willbedetailed, citing case prece-
dents, analyzing the facts, theap-
295

option
plicable lawandthearguments
oftheattorneys fortheparties.
Those opinions considered bythe
court tobeworthy ofserving asa
precedent orinvolving important
legal issues willbepublished in
the official reports available in
most law libraries. Since appeals
courts haveanywhere from three
toninejudges, there areoften “dis-
senting opinions” which disagree
with themajority opinion, and
“concurring opinions” which agree
withtheresult, butapply different
emphasis, precedents orlogic to
reach thedetermination. Normally
themajority opinion identifies the
author, butsome brief opinions are
labeled “inbanc” (bythebench) or
“percuriam” (bythecourt) in
which theauthor isnotspecified.
Man isacreature endowed
withreason andfree will;but
when hegoes tolawasplain-
tiff,hisreason seems tohave

option: n.aright topurchase proper-
tyorrequire another toperform
upon agreed-upon terms.Anoption
ispaid foraspartofacontract, but
must be“exercised” inorder forthe
property tobepurchased ortheper-
formance oftheother party tobe
required. “Exercise” ofanoption
normally requires notice andpay-
ment ofthecontract price. Thus, a
potential buyer ofatract ofland
might pay$5,000 fortheoptionwhich gives him/her aperiod oftime
todecide ifhe/she wishes topurchase,
tyinguptheproperty forthat period,
andthenpay$500,000 fortheproper-
ty.Ifthetime toexercise theoption ex-
pires then theoption terminates. The
amount paid fortheoption itself isnot
refundable since thefunds bought the
option whether exercised ornot.Often
anoption istheright torenew acon-
tract such asalease, broadcasting a
television series, theemployment of
anactor orathlete, orsome other ex-
isting business relationship. A“lease-
option” contract provides foralease of
property with theright topurchase
theproperty during orupon expira-
tionofthelease.
or:conj. either; inthealternative. Itis
often vital todistinguish between
“or”and “and.” Example: Title to
theCadillac written “Mary orBill
Davidson” means either onecould
transfer thecar,but ifwritten “Mary
and BillDavidson,” bothmust sign
tochange title.
O.R.: n.short for“own recognizance,”

oralcontract: n.anagreement made
with spoken words and either no
writing oronly partially written. An
oral contract isjust asvalid asa
written agreement. Themain prob-
lemwithanoralcontract isproving
itsexistence ortheterms. Asone
wagobserved: “Anoralcontract isas
good asthepaper it’swritten on.”An
oralcontract isoften provable byac-
296

ostensible agent
tiontaken byoneorboth parties
which isobviously inreliance on
theexistence ofacontract. The
other significant difference be-
tween oralandwritten contracts is
that thetime tosueforbreach of
anoralcontract (thestatute oflim-
itations) issometimes shorter. For
example, California’s limitation is
twoyears fororalcompared tofour
forwritten, Connecticut andWash-
ington three fororalrather than
sixforwritten, andGeorgia four
fororalinstead of20forwritten.

order toshow cause: n.ajudge’s
written mandate thataparty appear
incourt onacertain dateandgive
reasons, legal and/or factual, (show

method ofmaking aparty appear
with proof and legal arguments is
applied tocases ofpossible contempt
forfailure topaychild support, sanc-

objection toaquestion toawitness
oradmission ofevidence. Byover-
ruling theobjection, thetrialjudge
allows thequestion orevidence in
court. Ifthejudge agrees withthe
objection, he/she “sustains” theob-

owe: v.tohave alegal duty topay
funds toanother. However, toowe

“payable” ifthedate forpayment
hasnotyetarrived. (See: debt,
due,payable)own: v.tohave legal title orright to
something. Mere possession isnot
ownership.
owner: n.onewhohaslegal title or
right tosomething. Contrary tothe
cynical adage: “Possession isnine-
tenths ofthelaw,” possession does
notnecessarily make onealegal
owner. (See:own)

exclusive legal right topossession.
Co-ownership, however, means that
morethanoneperson hasalegal in-
terest inthesame thing. (See:own)

ofthecrime charged, thelikelihood
thedefendant willalways appear,
thelength oftime theperson has
lived inthearea, his/her reputation
inthecommunity, his/her employ-
ment, financial burdens andthede-
meanor oftheaccused. Inminor
crimes, traffic offenses andtechnical
lawviolations such asleaky septic
systems, judges routinely grant re-
lease onone’sown recognizance.

married butlived together foralong
period andthenterminated their rela-
tionship. Thekey issue iswhether
therewasanagreement thatonepart-
nerwould support theother inreturn
forthesecond making ahomeandper-
forming other domestic duties beyond
sexual pleasures. Written palimony
contracts arerare,butthecourts have
found “implied” contracts, when a
woman hasgiven upher career,
managed thehousehold orassisted in
theman’s business foralengthy peri-
odoftime. Inthepast20years pal-
imony suitshave proliferated, particu-
larly against celebrities andwealthy
businessmen, buttheearliest wasthe
famous California caseofSarah Althea
Hill v.Senator William Sharon inthe
1880s, which Ms. Hill lost.The line
between amutual “affair” andarela-
tionship warranting palimony isa
difficult onewhich must bedecided on
acasebycase basis. Palimony suits
maybeavoided bycontracts written
prior toorduring therelationship.

partner
Partition cases arecommon when
co-owners differ onwhether tosell,
keep ordivide theproperty.
partner: n.1)oneoftheco-owners
and investors ina“partnership”
which isanon-going business enter-
prise entered intoforprofit.A“gen-
eralpartner” isresponsible forthe
debts, contracts andactions ofall
thepartners inthebusiness, isan
equal inmanagement decisions un-
lessthere isanagreement estab-
lishing management duties and
rights, andshares intheprofits and
losses based onthepercentage of
theinvestment (either inmoney or
effort) inthepartnership. A“limited
partner” doesnotshare responsibil-
ityfordebts beyond his/her invest-
ment, cannot share inmanagement,
andshares inprofits based ona
written agreement. A“silent part-
ner” isnodifferent fromanypartner
except he/she isnotvisible tothe
public andhasnopart inday-to-day
management. 2)slang for“domestic
partner,” usually twopeople living
together, either homosexual orhet-
erosexual, sharing livesandposses-
sions, andnotmarried. (See: do-
mestic partners, general part-
ner, limited partner, limited
partnership, partnership)
partnership: n.abusiness enter-
prise entered into forprofit which
isowned bymorethanoneperson,
each ofwhom isa“partner.” A
partnership maybecreated bya
formal written agreement, but
maybebased onanoral agree-
ment orjustahandshake. Each
partner invests acertain amount
(money, assets and/or effort) which
establishes anagreed-upon per-centage ofownership, isresponsible
forallthedebts andcontracts ofthe
partnership even though another
partner created thedebt orentered
into thecontract, hasashare in
management decisions, andshares
inprofits andlosses according tothe
percentage ofthetotal investment.
Often apartnership agreement may
provide forcertain division ofman-
agement, shares ofinvestment, prof-
itand/or rights tobuyoutapartner
upon leaving thepartnership or
death. Each partner owes theother
partners aduty offulldisclosure of
information which affects thebusi-
ness andcannot commandeer for
himself/herself business opportuni-
tieswhich rightfully belong tothe
partnership. Apartnership which
does business under atradename
must filewith thecounty orstate a
certificate of“doing business under a
fictitious name,” which gives notice
tothepublic ofthenames ofpart-
nersandthebusiness address. A
“limited partnership” limits there-
sponsibility fordebts beyond thein-
vestment tothemanaging “general
partners.” The investing “limited
partners” cannot participate inman-
agement andarelimited tospecific
percentages ofprofit.Apartnership
differs from a“joint venture,” which
involves more than oneinvestor for
onlyaspecific short-term project and
prompt division ofprofits. Partner-
ships aretraditionally themost frag-
ileofbusiness arrangements andare
often dissolved and subject todis-
putes. Butseveral million exist in
theUnited States and, ironically,
theyarethefavorite business entity
forlaw firms. (See:general part-
ner, partner, limited partner-
ship, silent partner)

passive
party: n.1)oneoftheparticipants in
alawsuit orother legal proceeding
whohasaninterest intheoutcome.
Parties include plaintiff (person fil-
ingsuit), defendant (person sued or
charged with acrime), petitioner
(files apetition asking foracourt
ruling), respondent (usually inop-
position toapetition oranappeal),
cross-complainant (adefendant
whosuessomeone elseinthesame
lawsuit), orcross-defendant (aper-
sonsuedbyacross-complainant). 2)
aperson orentity involved inan
agreement. 3)acommon reference
bylawyers topeople orentities in-
volved inlawsuits, transactions,
contracts oraccidents, asin“both
parties knew whatwasexpected,”
“he isaparty tothecontract,” “he
wasnotaparty tothecriminal con-
spiracy....” (See: contract, cross-
complaint, defendant, indis-
pensable party, necessary
party, petitioner, plaintiff,
proper party, realparty inin-
terest, respondent)
party ofthefirst part: n.reference
inawritten contract toidentify
oneofthepeople entering intothe
agreement. Theagreement would
read “Mary McConnell (here-
inafter called TheParty ofthe
First Part).” Better practice isto
identify theparties byashortform
oftheirname (“hereinafter re-
ferred toasMcConnell”) oras
Buyer, Seller, Owner, Trustee or
some other useful identification.
Name useaidsinfollowing andun-
derstanding the contract and
avoids confusion with “theparty of
thesecond part,” which identifies
another party totheagreement.Itisnotwhatalawyer tells
meImay do;butwhat hu-
manity, reason, and justice
tellmeIought todo.—Edmund Burke
party ofthesecond part: n.a
reference toaparty toawritten con-

afee(acommon carrier). Apassenger
isowedaduty ofcarebysuch acarri-
erandhasaright tosuefordamages
forinjuries suffered while being trans-
ported without proof ofnegligence.
One tricky issue iswhether aperson
whohasentered thedepot, station or
airport, butnotyetpurchased aticket
orhasnotboarded, isentitled tothe
rights ofapassenger torecover for

ment offarewho isinjured must prove

patent: 1)adj.obvious. Used insuch
expressions asa“patent defect” in
anappliance. 2)n.anexclusive

Patent Office, foraspecific period of
time, onthebasis that itisnovel
(notpreviously known ordescribed
inapublication), “non-obvious” (a
formwhich anyone inthefieldofex-
pertise could identify), and useful.
There arethree types ofpatents:
a)“utility patent” which includes a
process, amachine (mechanism
withmoving parts), manufactured
products, andcompounds ormix-
tures (such aschemical formulas);
b)“design patent” which isanew,
original andornamental design
foramanufactured article; and
c)“plant patent” which isanew va-
riety ofacultivated asexually repro-
duced plant. Example: Secretary of
Agriculture andlater VicePresident
Henry A.Wallace developed hybrid
comwhichmadehimrich forlife.A
utility orplant patent lasts 17years
andadesign patent lasts 14years,
but alltypes require payment
of“maintenance” feespayable be-
ginning 31/2years after the is-
suance tokeepthem up.Patent law
specialists canmake asearch ofpatents todetermine iftheproposed
invention istruly unique, and ifap-
parently so,can fileanapplication, in-
cluding detailed drawing and specifi-
cations. While awaiting issuance of
thepatent, products ordesigns should
bemarked “patent pending” or“pat.
pending.” Upon receiving thepatent
theproduct canbemarked with the
word “patent” andthenumber desig-
nated bythePatent Office. Therights

signment issigned andnotarized to
create arecord or“licensed” foruse.

andtheprosecutor ontheother, in
which thedefendant agrees toplead

crimes, inreturn forreduction of
theseverity ofthecharges, dis-
missal ofsome ofthecharges, the
prosecutor’s willingness torecom-
mend aparticular sentence orsome
other benefit tothedefendant.
Sometimes oneelement ofthebar-
gain isthatthedefendant reveal in-
formation such aslocation ofstolen
goods, names ofothers participating
inthecrime oradmission ofother
crimes (such asastring ofburglar-
ies).Thejudge must agree tothere-
sultofthepleabargain before ac-

thebargain iscancelled. Reasons
forthebargain include adesire to
cutdown onthenumber oftrials,
danger tothedefendant ofalongterm inprison ifconvicted after trial
andtheability togetinformation on
criminal activity from thedefendant.
There arethree dangers: a)aninno-
centdefendant maybepressured into
aconfession andpleaoutoffearofa
severe penalty ifconvicted; b)particu-
larly vicious criminals willgetlenient
treatment andbeback “onthestreet”

ahost ofstate regulatory statutes.political question: n.thedetermina-
tionbyacourt (particularly the

cannot print examples forthecourts
tofollow. (See:obscene)

casesmake plaintiffs look foolish and
unrealistic. (See:complaint, default
judgment)
precatory: adj.referring toawish or
advisory suggestion which does not
have theforce ofademand orare-
quest which under thelawmust be
obeyed. Thus “precatory words” ina
willortrust would express a“hope
thatmydaughter willkeep thehouse
inthefamily,” butdonotabsolutely
prevent herfrom selling it.
precedent: 1)n.aprior reported opin-
ionofanappeals court which estab-
lishes thelegal rule(authority) inthe
future onthesame legal question de-
cided intheprior judgment. Thus,
“the ruleinFishbeck v.Gladfelter is
precedent fortheissue before the
court inthiscase.” Thedoctrine that
alower courtmust follow aprecedent
iscalled stare decisis 2)adj.before, as
intheterm “condition precedent,”
which isasituation which must exist
before aparty toacontract has to
perform. (See:stare decisis)
predecease: v.todiebefore someone
else, as“ifmybrother, Harry, should
predecease me,hisshare ofmyestate
Igive tohisson,Eugene.”
preemption: n.theruleoflawthat if
thefederal government through Con-
gress hasenacted legislation ona
subject matter itshall becontrolling
over state laws and/or preclude the
statefrom enacting lawsonthesame
subject ifCongress has specifically
319

preemptive right
stated ithas“occupied thefield.” If
Congress hasnotclearly claimed
preemption, afederal orstate court
maydecide theissue onthebasis of
history ofthelegislation (debate in
Congress) and practice. Example:
federal standards ofmeat orother
products have preempted state
laws. However, federal and state
legislation onnarcotics control may
parallel each other.
preemptive right: n.theright ofa
shareholder inacorporation tohave
the firstopportunity topurchase a
new issue ofstock ofthat corpora-
tion inproportion totheamount of
stock already owned bytheshare-
holder. (See: corporation, share-
holder, stock)
preference: n.inbankruptcy, the
payment ofadebt toonecreditor
rather than dividing theassets
equally among allthose towhom
he/she/it owesmoney, oftenbymak-
ingapayment toafavored creditor
justbefore filing apetition tobede-
clared bankrupt. Such apreference
isprohibited bylaw,andthe fa-
vored creditor mustpaythemoney
tothebankruptcy trustee. Howev-
er,thebankruptcy courtmay give
secured creditors (with ajudgment,
lien,deed oftrust, mortgage orcol-
lateralized loan) alegal preference
over “general” creditors indistrib-
uting available funds orassets.
(See:bankruptcy)
preferred dividend: n.apayment
ofacorporation’s profits toholders
ofpreferred shares ofstock. (See:
preferred stock)
preferred stock: n.aclass ofshares ofstock inacorporation
which gives theholders priority in
payment ofdividends (and distribu-
tionofassets incase ofdissolution of
thecorporation) overowners of“com-
mon” stock atafixed rate.While the
assurance offirstchance atprofits is
apsychological andrealbenefit, pre-
ferred stock shareholders donotpar-
ticipate inhigher dividends ifthe
corporation makes large profits, and
usually cannot vote fordirectors.

preliminary hearing: n.incriminal
law,ahearing todetermine ifaperson
charged withafelony (aserious crime
punishable byaterm inthestate
prison) should betried forthecrime
charged, based onwhether there is
some substantial evidence thathe/she
committed thecrime.Apreliminary
hearing isheld inthelowest local
court (municipal orpolice court), but
only iftheprosecutor has filed the
charge without asking theGrand Jury
foranindictment forthealleged
crime. Such ahearing must beheld
within afewdays afterarraignment
(presentation incourt ofthecharges
and thedefendant’s right toplead
guilty ornotguilty). Since neither side
wants toreveal itstrial strategy, the
prosecution normally presents only
enough evidence andtestimony to
show theprobability ofguilt,andde-
fendants often putonnoevidence at
320

preponderance oftheevidence
allatthepreliminary hearing, un-
lessthere isastrong chance ofget-
tingthecharges dismissed. Ifthe
judge finds sufficient evidence totry
thedefendant, thecase issent tothe
appropriate court (variously called
superior, county, district, common
pleas) fortrial. Ifthere isnosuch
convincing evidence, thejudge will
dismiss thecharges. Inthe“Perry
Mason” television series, thecourt-
room scenes were almost always of
preliminary hearings. (See: ar-
raignment, charge, Grand Jury,
information)
preliminary injunction: n.acourt
ordermade intheearly stages ofa
lawsuit orpetition which prohibits
theparties from doinganactwhich
isindispute, thereby maintaining
thestatus quountil there isafinal
judgment after trial. (See: injunc-
tion, permanent injunction,
temporary injunction)
premeditation: n.planning, plotting
ordeliberating before doing some-
thing. Premeditation isanelement
infirstdegree murder andshows in-
tenttocommit thatcrime. (See: first
degree murder, malice afore-
thought, murder)
premises: n.1)inreal estate, land
and theimprovements on it,a
building, store, shop, apartment, or
other designated structure. The
exact premises maybeimportant in
determining ifanoutbuilding
(shed, cabana, detached garage) is
insured orwhether aperson ac-
cused ofburglary hasactually en-
tered astructure. 2)inlegal plead-
ing,premises means “allthathas
hereinabove been stated,” asinaprayer (request) attheendofacom-
plaint asking for“any further order
deemed proper inthepremises” (an
order based onwhat hasbeen stated
inthecomplaint). (See: real estate,
structure)
premium: n.1)payment forinsurance
coverage either inalumpsum orby
installments. 2)anextrapayment for
anact,option orpriority.
prenuptial agreement: n.also called
anantenuptial agreement, awritten
contract between twopeople whoare
about tomany, setting outtheterms of
possession ofassets, treatment offu-
tureearnings, control oftheproperty of
each,andpotential division ifthemar-
riage islater dissolved. These agree-
ments arefairlycommon ifeither or
both parties have substantial assets,
children fromaprior marriage, poten-
tialinheritances, highincomes, orhave
been “taken” byaprevious spouse.
(See:antenuptial agreement)
preponderance oftheevidence: n.
thegreater weight oftheevidence re-
quired inacivil(non-criminal) lawsuit
forthetrier offact(jury orjudge with-
outajury) todecide infavor ofoneside
ortheother. This preponderance is
based onthemore convincing evidence
and itsprobable truth oraccuracy, and
notontheamount ofevidence. Thus,
one clearly knowledgeable witness
may provide apreponderance ofevi-
dence over adozen witnesses with
hazy testimony, orasigned agreement
with definite terms may outweigh
opinions orspeculation aboutwhat the
parties intended. Preponderance ofthe
evidence isrequired inacivilcaseand
iscontrasted with“beyond areason-
abledoubt,” which isthemore severe

prescription: n.themethod ofac-
quiring aneasement upon anoth-
er’srealproperty bycontinued and
regular usewithout permission of
theproperty owner foraperiod of
years required bythelawofthe
state (commonly five years or
more). Examples: Phillip Packer
drives across thecorner ofRalph
Roundup’s ranch toreach Packer’s
barn regularly foraperiod often
years; foradecade Ronald Retailer
uses the alley behind Marjorie
Howard’s house toreach hisstore-
room. Ineach case theresult isa
“prescriptive easement” forthat
specific use. Iteffectively gives the
useraneasement forusebutnot

prescriptive easement: n.anease-
mentupon another’s realproperty
acquired bycontinued usewithout
permission oftheowner foraperi-
odprovided bystate lawtoestab-
lishtheeasement. Theproblems
with prescriptive easements are
thatthey donotshowupontitle
reports, andtheexact location
and/or use oftheeasement is
notalways clearandoccasionally
moves bypractice orerosion. (See:
easement, prescription)presentment: n.1)making ademand
forpayment ofapromissory note
when itisdue. 2)areport toacourtby
aGrand Jury,made onitsown initia-
tivewithout arequest orpresentation
ofevidence bythe local prosecutor,
thata“public” crime (illegal actby
public officials oraffecting thepublic
good) hasbeen committed. (See:
Grand Jury, promissory note)
presiding judge: n.1)inboth state
andfederal appeals court, thejudge
whochairs thepanel ofthree ormore
judges during hearings andsuper-
vises thebusiness ofthecourt. 2)in
those counties orother jurisdictions
with several judges, theone ischo-
sentodirect themanagement ofthe
courts, usually onanannual orother
rotating basis. Thepresiding judge
usually makes assignments ofjudges
tospecialized courts (juvenile, pro-
bate, criminal, lawandmotion, fam-
ilylaw, etc.), oversees thecalendar,
andchairs meetings ofthejudges.
presumption: n.arule oflawwhich
permits acourt toassume afact istrue
until suchtime asthere isaprepon-
derance (greater weight) ofevidence
which disproves oroutweighs (rebuts)
thepresumption. Eachpresumption is
based upon aparticular setofappar-
entfacts paired with established laws,
logic, reasoning orindividual rights.A
presumption isrebuttable inthat it
canberefuted byfactual evidence.
Onecanpresent facts topersuade the
judge thatthepresumption isnottrue.
Examples: achildbom ofahusband
andwifeliving together ispresumed to
bethenatural child ofthehusband un-
lessthere isconclusive proof itisnot;a
person whohasdisappeared andnot
beenheard from forseven years ispre-
322

price fixing
sumed tobedead, butthepresump-
tion could berebutted ifhe/she
isfound alive; anaccused person is
presumed innocent until proven
guilty. These aresometimes called
rebuttable presumptions todistin-
guish them from absolute, conclu-
siveorirrebuttable presumptions in
which rules oflawand logic dictate
thatthere isnopossible waythepre-
sumption canbedisproved. Howev-
er,ifafact isabsolute itisnottruly
apresumption atall,butacertainty.
presumption ofinnocence: n.a
fundamental protection foraper-
sonaccused ofacrime, which re-
quires theprosecution toprove
itscaseagainst thedefendant be-
yond areasonable doubt. This is
opposite from thecriminal lawin
many countries, where theaccused
isconsidered guilty until he/
sheproves his/her innocence orthe
government completely fails to
prove itscase. (See:beyond area-
sonable doubt, presumption)
pretermitted heir: n.thechild ofa
person whohaswritten awill in
which thechild isnotleftanything
and isnotmentioned atall.After
thedeath oftheparent, apreter-
mitted heirhastheright todemand
theshare he/she would have re-
ceived asanheirunder thelaws of
distribution anddescent. The rea-
soning isthattheparent either in-
advertently forgot thechild orin-
correctly believed thechild was
dead, anddidnotmean toleave
him/her out.Thus, ifsomeone wish-
estodisinherit achild oromit
him/her from his/her will, that
parent should specifically state in
thewill: “Ileave nothing tomyson,Gordon,” with orwithout areason.
Otherwise theremay beunfair and
unintended results. Example: Tommy
Testator hasthree children, givestwo
ofthem $10,000 each, andthe re-
mainder (which turns outtobeamil-
lion dollars) tosetupascholarship
fund fororphans. Hisomitted child,
whohasnotspoken tohim for20
years, isapretermitted heir entitled
toone-third oftheestate, andwillre-
ceive $340,000 compared tohissib-
lings’ specified $10,000 each. (See:
distribution anddescent, heir)
pretrial discovery: n.(See: discov-
ery)
prevailing party: n.thewinner in
alawsuit. Many contracts, leases,
mortgages, deeds oftrust orpromis-
sorynotes provide thatthe“prevail-
ingparty” shall beentitled torecov-
eryofattorney’s feesandcosts iflegal
action must betaken toenforce the
agreement. Even iftheplaintiff gets
much lessthan theclaim, he/she/it is
theprevailing party entitled toin-
clude attorney’s feesinthecollectable
costs. Usually there isnoprevailing
partywhen acomplaint isvoluntarily
dismissed prior totrial orsettled be-
foreorafter trialhasbegun.
price fixing: n.acriminal violation of
federal antitrust statutes inwhich sev-
eralcompeting businesses reach ase-
cretagreement (conspiracy) toset
prices fortheir products toprevent
realcompetition andkeep thepublic
from benefitting from price competi-
tion. Price fixing alsoincludes secret
setting offavorable prices between
suppliers andfavored manufacturers
ordistributors tobeatthecompetition.

prima facie
prima facie :(pry-mah fay-shah) adj.
Latin for“atfirst look,” or“on its
face,” referring toalawsuit orcrim-
inalprosecution inwhich the evi-
dence before trial issufficient to
prove thecaseunless there issub-
stantial contradictory evidence pre-
sented attrial.Aprima facie case
presented toaGrand Jurybythe

ment. Example: inacharge ofbad
check writing, evidence ofahalf
dozen checks written onanon-exis-
tentbank account makes itaprima

bank hadmisprinted theaccount
number onthechecks might dis-
prove theprosecution’s apparent
“open andshut” case. (See:prima

prima facie case: n.aplaintiff’s law-
suitoracriminal charge which ap-
pears atfirstblush tobe“open and

prime suspect: n.theoneperson law
enforcement officers believe most
probably committed acrime being
investigated. Once aperson isdeter-
mined tobeaprime suspect, thepo-
licemust becareful togivethe“Mi-
randa warnings,” ortake therisk
thatanyadmissions (any evidence
gained from thestatements) bythe
suspect may beexcluded intrial.
(See:Miranda warning)
primogeniture: n.from Latin for
“first bom,” theancient rulefrom
feudal England (except intheCoun-
tyofKent) thattheoldest sonwould
inherit theentire estate ofhispar-
ents (ornearest ancestor), and, if
therewasnomale heir,thedaugh-
terswould take (receive theproper-ty)inequal shares. Theintent was to
preserve larger properties from being
broken upintosmall holdings, which
might weaken thepower ofnobles. It
does notexist intheUnited States.
(See:distribution anddescent)
principal: n.1)main person inabusi-
ness. 2)employer, theperson hiring
and directing employees (agents) to
perform his/her/its business. Itispar-
ticularly important todetermine who
istheprincipal since he/she/it isre-
sponsible fortheactsofagents inthe
“scope ofemployment” under thedoc-
trine ofrespondeat superior. 3)incrim-
inal law,themain perpetrator (orga-
nizerandactive committer) ofacrime,
asdistinguished froman“accessory”
whohelps theprincipal insome fash-
ion.Thecriminal principal isusually
theperson who originates theidea of
committing thecrime and/or directly
carries itout,and ismore likely tobe
charged with ahigher degree ofthe
crime, andreceive astiffer prison sen-
tence. 4)adj. chief, leading, highest.
(See: accessory, agency, agent, re-
spondeat superior)
principal place ofbusiness: n.loca-
tion ofhead office ofabusiness
where thebooks and records are
kept and/or management works. In
most states corporations must report
their principal place ofbusiness to
theSecretary ofState.
prior(s): n.slang foracriminal defen-
dant’s previous record ofcriminal
charges, convictions, orother judicial
disposal ofcriminal cases (such as
probation, dismissal oracquittal).
Only previous felony convictions can
beintroduced intoevidence. Howev-
er,therecord of“priors” canhavean
324

private parts
impact onsentencing, aswith
priordrunk driving convictions re-
quiring mandatory jailsentences,
and“three strikes, you’re out,” pro-
viding forextended sentences for
thethird felony conviction. (See:
three strikes, you’re out)
priority: n.theright tobefirst or
ahead oftherights orclaims ofoth-
ers.Inbankruptcy law,theright to
collect before other creditors isgiven
totaxing authorities, judgment
holders, secured creditors, bank-
ruptcy trustees andattorneys. The
right alsocanapply tomortgages,
deeds oftrusts orliensgiven priority
intheorder theywere recorded (in
the“race tothecourthouse”).
prior restraint: n.anattempt to
prevent publication orbroadcast of
anystatement, which isanuncon-
stitutional restraint onfreespeech
andfreepress (even intheguise of
ananti-nuisance ordinance). Stem-
mingfrom theFirstAmendment to
theConstitution, thebanonprior
restraint allows publication oflibel,
slander, obvious untruths, anti-
government diatribes, racial and
religious epithets, andalmost any
material, except ifpublic security
orpublic safety isendangered
(false claim ofpoison inthereser-
voir orexhortation tocommit a
crime likealynching) andsome
forms ofpornography. The theory,
articulated bytheU.S.Supreme
Court inNear v.Minnesota (1931)
isthat freespeech and freepress
protections have priority, andlaw-
suits forlibelandslander andpros-
ecutions forcriminal advocacy will
curb theeffect ofdefamation and
untruths. Most other nations per-mitprior restraint bycourt order or
police action when thematerial ap-
pears tobedefamatory (hurtful lies),
salacious (nasty), or“improper, mis-
chievous, orillegal” (inthewords of
SirWilliam Blackstone).
privacy: n.theright tobefreeofun-
necessary public scrutiny ortobelet
alone. Once aperson isa“public fig-
ure” orinvolved innewsworthy
events, theright toprivacy may
evaporate. (See: public figure,
right toprivacy)
private carrier: n.onewho provides
transportation ordelivery ofgoods for
money, justfortheparticular instance,
andnotasaregular business. Itisdis-
tinguished from a“common carrier”
which isinthebusiness, such as
buses, railroads, trucking companies,
airlines and taxis. However, aprivate
carrier may beliable forinjuries to
anyone whopays orshares thecostof
transport. (See:common carrier,
guest statute)
private nuisance: n.theinterference
withanindividual’s peaceful enjoy-
ment ofone’s property, which canbe
thebasis foralawsuit both fordam-
agescaused bythenuisance andan
order (injunction) against continuing
thenoxious (offensive) activity orcon-
dition. Examples: fumes fromafacto-
ryabove thelegal limit, loud noises
wellabove thenorm, directing rain
water ontoanother person’s property,
operating anautorepair business ina
neighborhood zoned residential, ornu-
merous barking dogs. (See:nuisance,
public nuisance)
private parts: n.men’s orwomen’s gen-
italia, excluding awoman’s breasts,
325

private property
usually referred toinprosecutions
for“indecent exposure” orproduc-
tionand/or saleofpornography.
private property: n.landnotowned
bythegovernment ordedicated to
public use.
private road: n.aroad ordriveway
onprivately owned property, limit-
edtotheuseoftheowner ora
group ofowners whoshare theuse
andmaintain theroad without
helpfrom agovernment agency. A
private roadhasnotbeen given to
agovernment entity (likeacounty
orcity)andaccepted bythatentity
forpublic use.Some private roads
areusedbythepublic, butshould
beclosed offatleast onceayear to
prove thataneasement ofuse is
notallowed and toprevent apre-
scriptive easement (taken bycon-
tinued use)from arising. (See:
prescriptive easement)
privilege: n.aspecial benefit, exemp-
tionfrom aduty, orimmunity from
penalty, given toaparticular per-
son,agroup oraclass ofpeople.
privilege against selfincrimina-
tirn:n.aright torefuse totestify
against oneself inacriminal pros-
ecution orinanylegal proceeding
which might beused against the
person. This privilege isguaran-
teedbytheFifthAmendment to
theConstitution, which provides:
“Noperson... shall becompelled in
anycriminal case tobeawitness
against himself....” Therefore, re-
fusing toanswer questions during
atrial (“Irefuse toanswer onthe
ground itmaytend toincriminate
me”) iscalled “taking theFifth.”(See: BillofRights, taking the
Fifth)
privileged communication: n.state-
ments andconversations made under
circumstances ofassured confiden-
tiality which must notbedisclosed in
court. These include communications
between husband and wife, attorney
and client, physician ortherapist and
patient, andminister orpriest with
anyone seeing them intheir religious
status. Insome states theprivilege is
extended toreporters andinformants.
Thus, such people cannot beforced to
testify orreveal theconversations to
lawenforcement orcourts, evenunder
threat ofcontempt ofcourt, and ifone
should break theconfidentiality he/she
canbesued bytheperson whohad
confidence inhim/her. Thereason for
theprivilege istoallow people tospeak
withcandor tospouse orprofessional
counsellor, eventhough itmayhinder
acriminal prosecution. Theextreme
case iswhen apriest hears anadmis-
sionofmurder orother serious crime
intheconfessional andcandonothing
about it.The privilege maybelost if
theonewhomade theadmission
waives theprivilege, or,inthecase of
anattorney, iftheclient suestheat-
torney claiming negligence inconduct
ofthe case. (See: attorney-client
privilege, confidential physi-
cian-patient privilege)
privileges andimmunities: n.the
fundamental rights thatpeople enjoy
infreegovernments, protected bythe
U.S. Constitution inArticle IV:“The
citizens ofeach state shall beentitled
toallprivileges andimmunities in
theseveral States,” andspecifically to
beprotected against state action by
theConstitution’s 14thAmendment
326

probate
(1868): “NoState shallmake oren-
force anylawwhich shall abridge
theprivileges orimmunities ofciti-
zens oftheUnited States.” The defi-
nition of“privileges andimmunities”
was first spelled outbySupreme
Court Justice Bushrod Washington
in1823: “protection bythegovern-
ment, withtheright toacquire and
possess property ofevery kind, and
topursue andobtain happiness and
safety, subject, nevertheless, tosuch
restraints asthegovernment may
prescribe forthegeneral good ofthe
whole.” However, theexact nature of
privileges andimmunities which the
state governments could limit has
longbeen indispute, with theU.S.
Supreme Court gradually tipping to-
ward protecting the individual
rights ofcitizens against state
statutes thatmight impinge oncon-
stitutional rights.
privity: n.contact, connection ormu-
tual interest between parties. The
term isparticularly important in
thelawofcontracts, which requires
thatthere be“privity” ifoneparty to
acontract canenforce thecontract
byalawsuit against theother party.
Thus, atenant ofabuyer ofreal
property cannot suetheformer
owner (seller) oftheproperty for
failure tomake repairs guaranteed
bytheland sales contract between
seller andbuyer since thetenant
wasnot“inprivity” with the seller.
(See:contract)
probable cause: n.sufficient reason
based uponknown facts tobelieve
acrime hasbeencommitted orthat
certain property isconnected with
acrime. Probable cause must exist
foralawenforcement officer tomake anarrest without awarrant,
search without awarrant, orseize
property inthebelief theitems were
evidence ofacrime. While some cases
areeasy (pistols and illicit drugs in
plain sight, gunshots, asuspect run-
ningfrom aliquor store withaclerk
screaming “help”), actions “typical” of
drug dealers, burglars, prostitutes,
thieves, orpeople with guilt “written
across their faces,” aremore difficult
tocategorize. “Probable cause” is
often subjective, but ifthepolice offi-
cer’s belief orevenhunch was cor-
rect,finding stolen goods, thehidden
weapon ordrugsmaybeclaimed as
self-fulfilling proof ofprobable cause.
Technically, probable cause has to
exist prior toarrest, search or
seizure. (See: Bill ofRights,
search, search andseizure)
probate: 1)n.theprocess ofproving a
will isvalidandthereafter adminis-
tering theestate ofadead person ac-
cording totheterms ofthe will.The
first step istofilethepurported will

probation: n.achance toremain free
(orserve onlyashort time) given by
ajudge toaperson convicted ofa
crime instead ofbeing sent tojailor
prison, provided theperson canbe
good. Probation isonlygiven under
specific court-ordered terms, such as
performing public service work,
staying away from liquor, paying a
fine,maintaining good behavior, get-
tingmental therapy andreporting
regularly toaprobation officer.
Violation ofprobation terms will
usually result intheperson being
sent tojail forthenormal term.
Repeat criminals arenormally not
eligible forprobation. Probation is
notthesame as“parole,” which is
freedom under certain restrictions
given toconvicts attheendoftheir
imprisonment. (See: attorney-client privilege, physician-
patient privilege, confiden-
tialcommunication)
probative: adj.inevidence law,tend-
ing toprove something. Thus,
testimony which isnotprobative
(does notprove anything) isimmater-
ialandnotadmissible orwillbe
stricken from therecord ifobjected to
byopposing counsel. (See:probative
facts, probative value)
probative facts: n.evidence which
tends toprove something which isrel-
ative totheissues inalawsuit orcrim-
inal prosecution. (See: probative,

probative value: n.evidence which is
sufficiently useful toprove something
important inatrial. However, proba-
tivevalue ofproposed evidence must
beweighed bythetrialjudge against
prejudicing intheminds ofjurors to-

when theprosecutor wishes tointro-
duce theprevious conduct ofadefen-

tions, interrogatories; preparing or-
ders; giving notice totheother par-
ties;conduct oftrials; and allthe
rules and laws governing that
process. Every statehasasetofpro-
cedural statutes (often called the
Codes ofCivilProcedure andCrimi-
nalProcedure), andcourts have so-
called ‘local rules,” which govern
times forfiling documents, conduct
ofthecourts andother technicali-
ties.Law practice before thefederal
courts operates under theFederal
Rules ofCivil Procedure andthe
Federal Rules ofCriminal Proce-
dure. Procedural law isdistin-
guished from “substantive” law,
which involves thestatutes and
legal precedents upon which cases
aretriedandjudgments made.
proceeding: n.any legal filing,
hearing, trial and/or judgment in
theongoing conduct ofalawsuit or
criminal prosecution. Collectively
theyarecalled “proceedings,” asin
“legal proceedings.”
process: n.inlaw,thelegalmeans by
which aperson isrequired toap-
pear incourt oradefendant isgiven
notice ofalegal action against
him/her/it. When acomplaint ina
lawsuit isfiled, itmust beserved on
each defendant, together with a
summons issued bytheclerk ofthe
court stating theamount oftime(say,30days) inwhich thedefendant
hastofileananswer orother legal
pleading with theclerk ofthecourt,
andsent tothe plaintiff. NewYork
hasanunusual system inwhich a
summons maybeserved without a
complaint. Asubpena issimilar toa
summons but isanotice toawitness
toappear atadeposition (testimony
taken outside court), oratatrial.A
subpena duces tecum isanorder to
deliver documents orother evidence
either intocourt ortotheattorney for
aparty toalawsuit orcriminal pros-
ecution. Anorder toshow cause isa
court order toappear incourt and
giveareason whythecourt should
notissue anorder (such aspaying
temporary child support). Thesum-
mons, complaint, subpena, subpena
duces tecum andorder toshow cause
must allbe“served” onthedefendant
orperson required toappear orpro-
duce, and this iscalled “service of
process.” Service ofprocess isusually
made byanofficer ofthecourt suchas
adeputy sheriff ormarshal, orapro-
fessional process server, butcanbe
performed byothers inmost jurisdic-
tions. (See:order toshow cause,
process server, service ofprocess,
subpena, summons)
process server: n.aperson whoserves

professional corporation
sellers ofproducts tothepublic, to
deliver products free ofdefects
whichharm anindividual ornumer-
ouspersons and tomake goodon
that responsibility iftheir products
are defective. These caninclude
faulty auto brakes, contaminated
baby food, exploding bottles ofbeer,
flammable children’s pajamas or
lack oflabel warnings. Examples:
Beauty Queen HairProducts makes
ahair-permanent kitinwhich the
formula willcause loss ofhair to
women with sensitive scalps, and
MollyMakeup hasherhairdone at
theBonTbnBeauty Shopand suf-
fers scalpbums and loss ofhair.
Molly hasaclaim fordamages
against Beauty Queen, themanufac-
turer. BigBoyTrucks makes atmck
withafaulty steering gear, bought
byTbmHoldtight. Thegear failsand
Holdtight runs offtheroadand
breaks hisback. Holdtight cansue
BigBoyforthedamages. Thekey el-
ement inproduct liability law isthat
aperson who suffers harm need
prove onlythefailure oftheproduct
tomake theseller, distributor and/or
manufacturer reliable fordamages.
Aninjured person usually need only
suethe seller and lethim/her/it
bring themanufacturer ordistribu-
torintothelawsuit orrequire con-
tribution toward ajudgment. How-
ever, allthose possibly responsible
should benamed inthesuitasde-
fendants ifthey areknown. (See:

professional corporation: n.a
corporation formed forthepurpose
ofconducting aprofession which
requires alicense topractice, in-
cluding attorneys, physicians, den-
tists, certified public accountants,architects and real estate brokers.
Most states provide forsuch corpora-
tions under special statutes which
allow thecorporation tooperate
with asingle director, who isa
professional. However, unlike other
corporations, theorganization does
notprovide ashield forliability for
any professional negligence (mal-
practice) bythelicensed profession-
als.(See:corporation)

prohac vice: (proh hock vee-chay)
prep. Latin for“this time only,” the
phrase refers totheapplication ofan
out-of-state lawyer toappear incourt
foraparticular trial, even though
he/she isnotlicensed topractice inthe

contract law, iftheparties exchange
promises, eachpromise is“consider-

promissory estoppel: n.afalse
statement treated asapromise bya
courtwhen thelistener had relied
onwhat was told tohim/her to
his/her disadvantage. Inorder to
seethat justice isdone ajudge
willpreclude themaker ofthe
statement from denying it.Thus,
the legal inability oftheperson
whomade thefalse statement to
deny itmakes itanenforceable
promise called “promissory estop-
pel,” oran“equitable estoppel.” Ex-
ample: Bernie Blowhard tells
Arthur Artist thatBlowhard has
acontract tomake amovie and
wants Artist topaint theback-
ground scenery inreturn foraper-
centage oftheprofits. Artist paints,
andBlowhard thenadmits heneed-
edthescenery totrytogetamovie

andthejudge finds thatBlowhard
cannot deny acontract with Artist
andgives Artist judgment forthe

ofpayment may bewritten as:a)
whenever there isademand, b)ona
specific date, c)ininstallments with or
without theinterest included ineach
installment, d)installments with a
final larger amount (balloon payment).
Apromissory notemay contain other

usually heldbytheparty towhom the
money isowed. There arelegal limita-
tions totheamount ofinterest which
maybecharged. Charging arateinex-
cessofthelegal limit iscalled “usury,”
andthisexcess islegally uncollectible.
When theamount dueonthenote, in-
cluding interest andpenalties (ifany),
ispaid, thenotemust becancelled

proof: n.confirmation ofafactbyevi-

trierofthefact(jury orjudge without
ajury)needs tobecome satisfied that
there is“apreponderance oftheevi-
dence” incivil (non-criminal) cases
andthedefendant isguilty “beyond a
reasonable doubt” incriminal prose-
cutions. However, each alleged fact
must beproved separately, asmust
allthefacts necessary toreach a
judgment fortheplaintiff (theperson
filing alawsuit) orfortheprosecu-
tion (the “people” or“state” repre-
sented bytheprosecutor). Thedefen-
dants inboth civil suitsandcriminal
trials need notprovide absolute
“proof ofnon-responsibility inacivil

plaintiff orprosecution toprove then-
cases (orprove theperson guilty).

tiestothelegal action. However, the
judgment may leave some matters
undecided. Aproper party isdistin-
guished from a“necessary party,”
which thecourt willorder joined in
(brought into)thesuit ifanyjudgment
istobereached. Example: Marianne
Steel andIsaac Ironbothown lots
with vacation cabins upthe hillfrom
Allen Albright’s ranch, and foryears
both SteelandIronhave driven upan
oldroad across Albright’s property to
reach their cabins. Steel brings aquiet
title action against Albright toestab-

Restatement oftheLaw: n.aseries
ofdetailed statements ofthebasic
lawintheUnited States onavari-
etyofsubjects written andupdated
bywell-known legal scholars under
theauspices oftheAmerican Law
Institute since the1930s. While not
having theforce ofstatutes orofde-
cided precedents, theRestatement
(aslawyers generally call it)hasthe
prestige ofthescholars whohave
studied thelegal questions. Topics
covered include agency, contracts,
property, tortsandtrusts.
restitution: n.1)returning tothe
proper owner property orthemone-
taryvalue ofloss.Sometimes resti-
tution ismade partofajudgment in
negligence and/or contracts cases. 2)incriminal cases, oneofthepenalties
imposed isrequiring return ofstolen
goods tothevictim orpayment tothe
victim forharm caused. Restitution
maybeacondition ofgranting ade-
fendant probation orgiving him/her a
shorter sentence than normal.
restraining order: n.atemporary
order ofacourt tokeep conditions as
theyare(like nottaking achild out
ofthecounty ornotselling marital
property) until there canbeahear-
inginwhich both parties arepre-
sent.More properly itiscalled a
temporary restraining order (short-
ened toTRO). (See: injunction,
permanent injunction)
restraint onalienation: n.anattempt
inadeed orwilltoprevent thesaleor
other transfer ofrealproperty either
forever orforanextremely longperiod
oftime.Such arestraint onthefree-
dom totransfer property isgenerally
unlawful andtherefore void orvoid-
able(canbemade void ifamowner ob-
jects), since apresent owner should
notbeable totiethehands offuture
generations todealwith their proper-
ty.Thisbanonarestraint onalien-
ation (transfer) iscalled “the rule
against perpetuities.” Examples: Oliv-
erOldtimer sells hisranch tohisson
with thecondition that titlemay
never betransferred toanyone out-
sideofthefamily. Martha Oldtimer in
herwillgives herhome toherdaugh-
terJacqueline oncondition that
“Jacqueline’s descendants must never
selltheplace.” However, one isgener-
allyallowed tolimit transfer toamax-
imum period calculated by“lives in
being, plus21years.” Restraints on
alienation (so-called restrictive
covenants) based onrace (“only
359

restraint oftrade
Caucasians may hold title”) were
declared unconstitutional in1949.
(See: convey, deed, restrictive
covenant, ruleagainst perpetu-
ities, use)
restraint oftrade: n.inantitrust
law,any activity (including agree-
ments among competitors orcompa-
niesdoing business witheach other)
which tends tolimit trade, salesand
transportation ininterstate com-
merce orhasasubstantial impact
oninterstate commerce. Most of
these actions areillegal under the
various antitrust statutes. Some
state laws alsooutlaw local re-
straints oncompetitive business ac-
tivity. (See: antitrust laws, mo-
nopoly, trust)
restriction: n.anylimitation onac-
tivity, bystatute, regulation orcon-
tract provision. Inmulti-unit real
estate developments, condominium
and cooperative housing projects
managed byhomeowners’ associa-
tions orsimilar organizations, such
organizations areusually required
bystatelawtoimpose restrictions
onuse.Thus, therestrictions are
part ofthe“covenants, conditions
and restrictions” intended toen-
hance theuseofcommon facilities
andproperty which arerecorded
andincorporated intothe title of
eachowner. (See:covenants con-
ditions andrestrictions)
restrictive covenant: n.1)anagree-
ment included inadeed toreal
property that thebuyer (grantee)
willbelimited astothefuture useof
theproperty. Example: nofence
maybebuiltontheproperty except
ofdarkwoodandnotmorethan sixfeethigh,notennis court orswimming
poolmaybeconstructed within 30feet
oftheproperty line,andnostructure
canbebuilt within 20feet ofthe
frontage street. Commonly these
covenants arewritten sothattheycan
beenforced bythegrantor andother
owners inthesubdivision, sothat fu-
tureowners willbebound bythe
covenant (called “covenant running
with theland” ifenforceable against
future owners). All restrictive
covenants based onrace (“the proper-
tymay beoccupied only byCau-
casians”) were declared unconstitu-
tional in1949and ifthey stillshowon
deeds are null and void. (See:
covenant thatrunswith theland)
restrictive endorsement: n.anen-
dorsement signed ontheback ofa
check, note orbillofexchange which
restricts towhom thepapermaybe
transferred. Example: “for transfer
only toFrank Lowry, [signed] J.
Ripps.” Also spelled “indorsement.”
(See:endorsement)
result: n.common lawyer lingo forout-
come ofalawsuit.
resulting trust: n.atrust implied by
law(asdetermined byacourt) thata
person whoholds title orpossession
wasintended byagreement (implied
bythecircumstances) with the in-
tended owner toholdtheproperty for
theintended owner. Thus, theholder
isconsidered atrustee ofaresulting
trust fortheproper owner asbenefi-
ciary. Although alegal fiction, there-
sulting trust forces theholder tohonor
theintention andprevents unjust en-
richment. Example: Mahalia leaves
$100,000 with her friend, Albert,
while she isonatrip toEurope,
360

retroactive
asking him “tobuytheoldBarsallo
place ifitcomes onthemarket.” Al-
bertbuys theproperty, buthas title
put inhisownname, which the
court willfind isheld inaresulting
trust forMahalia. Aresulting trust
differs from a“constructive trust,”
which comes about when someone
byaccident, misunderstanding or
dishonesty comes intopossession of
property belonging toanother. (See:
constructive trust, trust)
retainer: n.theadvance payment to
anattorney forservices tobeper-
formed, intended toinsure thatthe
lawyer willrepresent theclient and
thatthelawyer willbepaid atleast
thatamount. Commonly inmatters
which willinvolve extensive work
there willbearetainer agreement
signed bytheattorney and client.
Further payments forservices can
beexpected asthetime spent on
the legal matter increases. Most
lawyers donotwant tobeowed
money andwish tobepaid either in
advance orpromptly asthework
isperformed. Onereason forthe
retainer, andtheproblem alawyer
faces, isthathe/she doesnotwant to
abandon aclient, butatthesame
timedoesnotwant tobestuck with
extensive unpaid fees. (See: attor-
ney’s fees)
retire: v.1)tostopworking atone’s
occupation. 2)topayoffapromis-
sory noteandthus “retire” the

room todecide onaverdict after all
evi-dence, argument andjury in-
structions havebeen completed.
retraction: n.1)towithdraw any
legaldocument inalawsuit orotherlegal proceeding, orwithdraw a
promise oroffer ofcontract. 2)in
defamation, particularly libel, thecor-
rection ofanyuntruth published ina
newspaper ormagazine orbroadcast
onradio ortelevision, usually upon
thedemand oftheperson aboutwhom
thedamaging false statement was
made.Aclearandcomplete retraction
willusually endtheright ofthede-
famed party togoforward withalaw-
suit fordamages for libel. Inmost
states aretraction must bedemanded
before thesuit isfiled inorder tocure
theproblem without litigation. (See:
defamation, libel)
retrial: n.anew trialgranted upon the
motion ofthelosing party, based on
obvious error, biasornewly discovered
evidence, orafter mistrial orreversed
byanappeals court. (See:motion for
new trial)
retroactive: adj.referring toacourt’s
decision orastatute enacted bya
legislative bodywhich would result
inapplication topast transactions
and legal actions. Incriminal law,
statutes which would increase penal-
ties ormake criminal activities
which hadbeen previously legal are
prohibited bytheconstitutional ban
onexpost facto laws (Article I,Sec-
tion 9).Most court decisions which
change theelements necessary to
prove acrime ortheintroduction of
evidence such asconfessions are
usually made non-retroactive topre-
vent aflood ofpetitions ofpeople
convicted under prior rules. Norcan
statutes orcourt decisions takeaway
“vested” property rights orchange
contract rights. However, some deci-
sions aresofundamental tojustice
theymayhave aretroactive effect,

general usetotaxpayers, taxpre-
parers, accountants andattorneys
inanticipating taxtreatment bythe
IRS.Theyhave theforce oflawuntil
otherwise determined bythefederal
taxcourt oranewrevenue ruling.
(See:income tax)
reversal: n.thedecision ofacourt of
appeal ruling thatthejudgment of
alower courtwasincorrect and is
therefore reversed. The result is
that thelower court which tried
thecase isinstructed todismiss
theoriginal action, retry thecase
orchange itsjudgment. Examples:
acourt which denied apetition for
writofmandate isordered toissue
thewrit.Alower court which gave
judgment withnoevidence ofdam-
ages isordered todismiss.
reversible error: n.alegalmistake
atthetrial court levelwhich isso

erjudgment) that thejudgment
must bereversed bytheappellate
court.Areversible error isdistin-
guished from anerror which isminor ordidnotcontribute tothe
judgment atthetrial. (See:reversal)
reversion: n.inrealproperty, there-
turn tothegrantor orhis/her heirs of
realproperty after allinterests inthe

ities only,” andthehospital iseven-
tuallytomdown andtheproperty is
nowvacant. Theproperty reverts to
George’s descendants, b)George wills
theproperty tohissister’s children
only,who later diedwithout children.
When thelastgrandchild dies the
property reverts toGeorge’s descen-
dants. Reversion isalso called “re-
verter.” (See: reverter)
reverter: n.synonymous with rever-
sion. (See:reversion)
review: n.thejudicial consideration ofa
lower courtjudgment byanappellate
court, determining ifthere were legal
errors sufficient torequire reversal.
Theprocess requires notice ofappeal,
obtaining atranscript ofthe trial or
hearing atthetrial level, obtaining all
thepleadings andother documents
filed intheoriginal triad, preparation
ofbriefs citing precedents andarguing
thattherewasreversible error.Then
therespondent (winner atthe trial
court)may filearesponsive brief,and
theappellant (theoneappealing the
decision) hasthechance tofileabrief
inresponse totherespondent. The
next step isoralargument (ifallowed)
before theappellate court. Appeals on
procedural issues normally donotin-
clude oralargument. Iftheappellate

savings andloan: n.abanking and
lending institution, chartered either
byastate orthefederal govern-
ment. Savings andloans onlymake
loans secured byrealproperty from
deposits, uponwhich theypayinter-
estslightly higher than thatpaidby
most banks. Intheearly 1980s sav-
ingsandloans were “de-regulated,”
allowing them tomake loans for
speculative land development, re-
moving high reserve funds require-
ments, andallowing their funds to
participate incompetition withbanks. The result wasuseofmany
savings andloans forspeculative and
dishonest investments, lack ofcon-
trolsandtremendous losses tothou-
sands ofdepositors. However, aprop-
erlymanaged, conservative savings

scienter :n.Latin for“having knowl-
edge.” Incriminal law, itrefers to
knowledge byadefendant thathis/her
actswere illegal orhis/her statements
were liesandthus fraudulent.
TheConstitution does notpro-
vide forfirstandsecond class
citizens.—Wendell L.Willkie
scintilla: n.Latin for“spark.” Scintil-
laiscommonly used inreference to
evidence, inthecontext that there
must bea“scintilla ofevidence” (at
least afaint spark) upon which to
baseajudgment.
scope ofemployment: n.actions ofan
employee which further thebusiness
oftheemployer andarenotpersonal
business, which becomes thetestasto
whether anemployer isliable for
damages due tosuch actions under
thedoctrine ofrespondeat superior
(make themaster answer). Example:
Dick Deliver drives atruck delivering
groceries forSuper-Duper Market. If
Dick negligently runs thetruck into
Victor Victim’sVWwhile making de-
liveries oronthewayback from a
369

scrivener
delivery, thenSuper-Duper isliable
since theaccident wasinthescope
ofemployment. IfDickgoesoutside
thedelivery route tohave lunch
with hisgirlfriend andontheway
hitsVictim thenthere isastrong in-
ference hewasoutside thescope of
employment. (See: master and
servant, respondeat superior)
scrivener: n.aperson whowrites a
document foranother, usually fora
fee. Ifalawyer merely writes out
theterms ofalease orcontract ex-
actly asrequested bythe client,
without giving legal advice, then
thelawyer isjustascrivener and
isprobably notresponsible for
legal errors (unless theywere so
obvious astowarrant comment). A
non-lawyer may actasascrivener
without getting introuble forprac-
ticing lawwithout alicense.
seal: n.adevice which creates anim-
pression uponpaper ormelted wax,
usedbygovernment agencies, cor-
porations and notaries public to
show thatthedocument isvalidly
executed, acknowledged orwit-
nessed, since theseal isunique to
thesealer. Corporate seals state the
name, dateandstate ofincorpora-
tion. Notaries increasingly usea
rubber stamp instead ofasealsince
their print iseasier tomicrofilm for
official recording than isafaintem-
bossed impression. Contracts used
tobe“sealed,” butthat israretoday.
sealed verdict: n.thedecision ofa
juiywhen there isadelay inan-
nouncing theresult, suchaswaiting
forthejudge, theparties andtheat-
torneys tocome back tocourt. The
verdict iskept inasealed envelopeuntilhanded tothejudgewhen court
reconvenes. (See: jury, verdict)
sealing ofrecords: n.trialrecords and
decisions which ajudge orders kept se-
cret. Usually these arethecriminal
records ofunder-age offenders which
cannot beexamined without aspecial
court order oronlybythose connected
with lawenforcement. Onoccasion
records incivil trials aresealed onthe
motion ofaparty claiming theneed to
protect inventions, business secrets or
national security. Sometimes sealing is
stipulated aspart ofasettlement to
keeptheterms from public scrutiny.
search: v.1)toexamine another’s
premises (including avehicle) tolook
forevidence ofcriminal activity. Itis
unconstitutional under the4thand
14thAmendments forlaw enforce-
ment officers toconduct asearch with-
outa“search warrant” issued bya
judge orwithout factswhich givethe
officer “probable cause” tobelieve evi-
dence ofaspecific crime isonthe
premises andthere isnotenough time
toobtain asearch warrant. 2)totrace
therecords ofownership ofrealprop-
erty inwhat iscommonly called a“title
search.” (See: abstract, chain of
title, probable cause, search and
seizure, search warrant)
search andseizure: n.examination of
aperson’s premises (residence, busi-
nessorvehicle) bylawenforcement of-
ficers looking forevidence ofthecom-
mission ofacrime, andthetaking
(seizure andremoval) ofarticles ofev-
idence (such ascontrolled narcotics,
apistol, counterfeit bills, ablood-
soaked blanket). The basic question
iswhether thesearch and seizure
were “unreasonable” under the4th
370

secret rebate
Amendment totheConstitution (ap-
plied tothestates under the14th
Amendment), which provides: “The
right ofpeople tobesecure intheir
persons, houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and
seizures, shall notbeviolated.”
Thus, searches andseizures must be
under theauthority ofasearch war-
rant orwhen the officer has solid
facts that givehim/her “probable
cause” tobelieve therewasevidence
ofaspecific crime onthepremises
butnotime togetawarrant. Evi-
dence obtained inviolation ofthe
Constitution isnotadmissible in
court, norisevidence traced through
such illegal evidence. (See:search,
search warrant, probable cause,
fruit ofthepoisonous tree)
search warrant: n.awritten order
byajudge which permits alawen-
forcement officer tosearch aspecific
place (eg.112Magnolia Avenue,
Apartment 3,ora1991 Pontiac,
Texas license number 123ABC) and
identifies thepersons (ifknown)
andany articles intended tobe
seized (often specified bytype, such
as“weapons,” “drugs anddrug para-
phernalia,” “evidence ofbodily
harm”). Such asearch warrant can
onlybeissued upon asworn written
statement ofalawenforcement offi-
cer(including aprosecutor). The4th
Amendment totheConstitution
specifies: “...no warrants shall
issue, butupon probable cause, sup-
ported byoath oraffirmation, and
particularly describing theplace to
besearched and thepersons or
things tobeseized.” The 14th
Amendment applies therule tothe
states. Evidence unconstitutionally
seized cannot beused incourt, norcanevidence traced through such ille-
galevidence. (See: fruitofthepoiso-
nous tree,probable cause, search,
search andseizure)
secondary boycott: n.anorganized
refusal topurchase theproducts of,do
business with orperform services for
(such asdeliver goods) acompany
which isdoing business withanother
company where theemployees areon
strike orinalabor dispute. Example:
BigBasket Markets arebeing struck
bytheRetail Clerks Union, andCup-
board Canning andWheato Bread are
selling foodstuffs toBigBasket. The
Teamsters Union then refuses tode-
liver toCupboard andWheato and
asks allitsmembers nottobuyfrom
those companies, although Cupboard
andWheato arenotinvolved directly
inthelabor dispute. Such “secondary”
boycotts areunfair labor practices
under federal andmany state laws
and, thus, areillegal.
second degree murder: n.anon-pre-
meditated killing, resulting froman
assault inwhich death ofthevictim
wasadistinct possibility. Second de-
greemurder isdifferent from first
degree murder, which isapremedi-
tated, intentional killing orresults
from avicious crime such asarson,
rapeorarmed robbery. Exact distinc-
tions ondegree varybystate. (See:
firstdegree murder, manslaugh-
ter,murder)
secret rebate: n.akickback ofmoney
byabusiness toa“preferred” cus-
tomer, notoffered tothepublic orbya
subcontractor toacontractor not
shown onajobestimate. Both are ille-
galinmost states asunfair business
practices andmay result incriminal

secured transaction
penalties orrefusal ofacourt toen-
force acontract (written ororal) in
which there issuchasecret rebate.
(See:rebate)
secured transaction: n.anyloan
orcredit inwhich property is
pledged assecurity intheevent
payment isnotmade. (See:deed
oftrust, lien,mortgage, pawn,
pawnshop, UCC-1)
securities: n.generic term forshares
ofstock, bonds anddebentures is-
sued bycorporations andgovern-
ments toevidence ownership and
terms ofpayment ofdividends or
final pay-off. They arecalled securi-
tiesbecause theassets and/or the
profits ofthecorporation orthecred-
itofthegovernment stand assecuri-
tyforpayment. However, unlike se-
cured transactions inwhich specific
property ispledged, securities are
onlyasgood asthefuture profitabil-
ityofthecorporation orthemanage-
ment ofthegovernmental agency.
Most securities aretraded onvari-
ousstock orbond markets. (See:
bond, debenture, stock, share, )
security deposit: n.apayment re-
quired byalandlord fromatenant
tocover theexpenses ofanyrepairs
ofdamages tothepremises greater
thannormal “wear and tear.” The
security deposit must bereturned
within ashort time (varying by
states) after thetenant vacates, less
thecost ofrepairing anyunusual
damage. Unfortunately fortenants,
these damages areusually subject
tothejudgment ofthelandlord, who
may desire topaintandrefinish on
thetenant’s money, which results in
many small claims suits. Inafewstates thesecurity deposit must be
kept inaseparate bank account, and
some states require payment ofinter-
estontheamount heldasadeposit. A
security deposit issometimes con-
fused with adeposit ofthe “last
month’s rent,” whichmaybecredited
tothetenant forthe final month’s
rent.Asecurity deposit cannot beused
legally asarent credit. (See:landlord
andtenant, lease, rent)
security interest: n.generic term for
theproperty rights ofalender orcred-
itorwhose right tocollect adebt isse-
cured byproperty. (See:deed of
trust, lien,mortgage, UCC-1)
sedition: n.thefederal crime ofadvo-
cacy ofinsurrection against thegov-
ernment orsupport foranenemy of
thenation during time ofwar, by
speeches, publications andorganiza-
tion. Sedition usually involves actual-
lyconspiring todisrupt thelegal op-
eration ofthegovernment and isbe-
yond expression ofanopinion or
protesting government policy. Sedi-
tion isalesser crime than “treason,”
which requires actual betrayal ofthe
government, or“espionage.” Espi-
onage involves spying onthegovern-
ment, trading state secrets (particu-
larly military) toanother country
(even afriendly nation), orsabotaging
governmental facilities, equipment or
suppliers ofthegovernment, likean
aircraft factory. During U.S. partici-
pation inWorld War II(1941-1945)
several leaders oftheGerman-Ameri-
canBund, apro-Nazi organization,
were triedandconvicted ofsedition
foractively interfering with thewar
effort. Since freedom ofspeech, press
andassembly areguaranteed bythe
BillofRights andbecause treason
372

self-defense
andespionage charges canbemade
forovert actsagainst thenation’s
security, sedition charges arerare.
(See:espionage, treason)
seduction: n.theuseofcharm, sales-
manship, promises, giftsand flat-
tery toinduce another person to
have sexual intercourse outside
marriage, without anyuseofforce
orintimidation. Atonetime seduc-
tionwasacrime inmany states, but
iftheseducee (usually female) isof
theageofconsent and isnot
drugged, intoxicated orotherwise
unable toconsent, seduction isno
longer criminal. However, just as
adultery lingers inthecriminal
codes ofsome states, sodoesseduc-
tion. (See: adultery, breach of
promise, daterape, rape)
seisin: (sees-in) n.anoldfeudal term
forhaving both possession and title
ofrealproperty. Theword isfound
insome olddeeds, meaning owner-
ship infeesimple (full title toreal
property). (See:feesimple, seized)
seized (seised): n.1)having owner-
ship,commonly used inwills as“I
give alltheproperty ofwhich Idie
seized asfollows:....” 2)having
taken possession ofevidence foruse
inacriminal prosecution. 3)having
taken property oraperson byforce.
(See: seisin, seizure)
seizure: n.thetaking bylawenforce-
ment officers ofpotential evidence
inacriminal case.Theconstitution-
allimitations onseizure arethe
same asforsearch. Thus, evidence
seized without asearch warrant or
without “probable cause” tobelieve
acrime hasbeen committed andwithout time togetasearch warrant,
cannot beadmitted incourt, norcan
evidence traced through the illegal
seizure. (See:search and seizure,
search warrant, fruit ofthepoiso-
nous tree)
self-dealing: n.inthestock market,
using secret “inside” information
gained bybeing anofficial ofacorpo-
ration (orfromsuchanofficer) tobuy
orsellstock (orrealproperty wanted
bythecorporation) before theinforma-
tionbecomes public (like amerger,
poor profit report, striking oil). Self-
dealing canalsoapply togeneral part-
ners ofalimited partnership whodo
notinform limited partners ofbusi-
ness opportunities which should be-
long tothepartnership. Self-dealing
canresult inalawsuit forfraud by
shareholders. Self-dealing with securi-
ties isacrime under thefederal Secu-
ritiesandExchange Act.
self-defense: n.theuseofreasonable
force toprotect oneself ormembers of
thefamily from bodily harm from the
attack ofanaggressor, ifthedefender
hasreason tobelieve he/she/they
is/are indanger. Self-defense isacom-
mon defense byaperson accused of
assault, battery orhomicide. Theforce
used inself-defense maybesufficient
forprotection from apparent harm
(notjustanempty verbal threat) orto
haltanydanger from attack, butcan-
notbeanexcuse tocontinue theat-
tackoruseexcessive force. Examples:
anunarmed manpunches Allen Alibi,
who hitstheattacker withabaseball
bat.That islegitimate self-defense,
butAlibi cannot chase after the at-
tacker andshoot him orbeathim
senseless. Iftheattacker hasagun
orabutcher knife and isverbally
373

self-executing
threatening, Alibi isprobably war-
ranted inshooting him. Basically,
appropriate self-defense isjudged
onallthecircumstances. Reason-
ableforcecanalsobeused toprotect
property from theft ordestruction.
Self-defense cannot include killing
orgreat bodilyharm todefend prop-
erty,unless personal danger isalso
involved, asisthecase inmost bur-
glaries, muggings orvandalism.
(See: assault, homicide)
self-executing: adj.immediately ef-
fective without further action, legis-
lation orlegal steps.Some statutes
areself-executing, asaresome legal
rights (such aswhen aperson holds
property assecurity and titlepasses
automatically when payments are
notmade). Mostjudgments inlaw-
suits arenotself-executing andare
onlydocuments giving thewinning
party theright totrytocollect.
self-help: n.1)obtaining relief oren-
forcing one’s rights without resort-
ingtolegal action, such asrepos-
sessing acarwhen payments have
notbeenmade, retrieving borrowed
orstolen goods, demanding and re-
ceiving payment orabating anui-
sance (such asdigging aditch todi-
vertflooding from another’s proper-
ty).Self-help islegal aslong asit
doesnot“break thepublic peace” or
violate some other law(although
brief trespass iscommon). 2)the
maximizing ofone’s opportunities.
self-incrimination: n.making state-
ments orproducing evidence which
tends toprove thatone isguilty ofa
crime. The5thAmendment tothe
U.S. Constitution guarantees that
onecannot “becompelled inanycriminal case tobeawitness against
himself...” andthe14thAmendment
applies thatguarantee tostate cases.
Thus refusing totestify incourtonthe
basis thatthetestimony maybeself-
incriminating iscalled “taking the
Fifth.” (See:Miranda warning,
rights, taking theFifth)
self-serving: adj.referring toaquestion
asked ofaparty toalawsuit orastate-
ment bythatperson that serves no
purpose andprovides noevidence, but
onlyargues orreinforces thelegal po-
sition ofthat party. Example: Question
asked byalawyer ofhisown client:
“Areyouthesortofperson whowould
never doanything dishonest?” Such a
question maybeobjected toas“self-
serving” bytheopposing lawyer and
willbedisallowed bythejudge, unless
there issome evidentiary value. Some
people add self-serving comments to
their testimony, such as“Inever tell
lies,”which canbestricken from the
record asaself-serving declaration.

sell: v.totransfer possession andowner-
ship ofgoods orother property for

sentence isordered bythejudge,
based ontheverdict ofthejury (or
thejudge’s decision ifthere isno

tothejailorprison time ordered
after conviction, asin“hissentence
was10years instate prison.” Tech-
nically, asentence includes allfines,
community service, restitution or
other punishment, orterms ofpro-
bation. Defendants whoarefirst of-
fenders without afelony recordmay
beentitled toaprobation orpre-sen-
tence report byaprobation officer
based onbackground information
andcircumstances ofthecrime,
often resulting inarecommenda-

(lesser crimes) themaximum sen-
tence isusually oneyear incounty
jail,butforfelonies (major crimes)
thesentence canrange fromayear

most states. Under some circum-
stances thedefendant mayreceive a
“suspended sentence,” which means
thepunishment isnotimposed if
thedefendant does notgetinto

would have spent injailorprison;
“concurrent sentences,” inwhich the

unspecified period oftime, perhaps
forever. Theagreement generally
covers anyalimony (money paid
forspousal support), child support,
custody arrangements ifthere are

management ofseparate bank ac-
counts. Aseparation agreement
maydetermine division ofproperty
iftheseparation appears perma-
nent. Itcannot beenforced by
court order unless oneparty filesa
petition forlegal separation orfiles
alawsuit forspecific performance
ofacontract. Ifthecouple recon-

agreements areinterim agree-
ments toserve between thetime of
separation andtheeventual di-
vorce oftheparties. (See: dissolu-
tionofmarriage, divorce, legal

sequester: v.tokeep separate or

criminal prosecutions (involving
major crimes, events orpersons
given wide publicity) thejury is
sometimes “sequestered” inahotel
without access tonews media, the
general public ortheir families ex-
ceptunder supervision, inorder to
prevent thejuryfrom being “taint-
ed”byinformation oropinions about
thetrial outside oftheevidence in
thecourtroom. Awitness maybese-
questered fromhearing thetestimo-
nyofother witnesses, commonly
called being “excluded,” until after
he/she has testified, supposedly to
prevent thatwitness frombeing in-
fluenced byother evidence ortailor-

summonses, subpenas andwrits, con-
ducting judgment sales, and fulfilling
various functions ordered bythe

United States fromEngland and is
unknown inmost nations which use
federal and state police. Canada, for
example, hasthehighly professional
Royal Canadian Mounted Police (and
itsQuebec equivalent) toserve for
mostnon-municipal lawenforcement.
Theposition ofsheriff hasbeen criti-
cized aslacking training standards,
being overly political, notbeing coor-
dinated with other jurisdictions, and
beinghampered byitslackofauthori-
tybeyond thecounty lineexcept when
in“hotpursuit” ofasuspect whocross-
esthecounty line.The sheriff’s uni-
formed police arecalled “deputy sher-
iffs,” with thenumber twoperson

differently from “long cause” cases,
such asnotrequiring asettlement

bereset later asa“long cause.”
shortening time: n.anorder ofthe
court inresponse tothemotion ofaparty toalawsuit which allows setting
amotion orother legal matter ata

andahearing must beheard promptly
bythejudge. Example: thelocal rules
require thataparty givetheother side
10days’ notice before ahearing. A
hearing onadding awitness totheex-
pert listwould beuseless unless heard
infivedays, since thetrial issettobe
called innine days. The courtmay

(male tomale) sodomy between con-
senting adults hasalsobeenfound a
felony butincreasingly iseither de-
criminalized orseldom prosecuted.
Sodomy with aconsenting adult fe-
male isvirtually never prosecuted
even inthose states inwhich itre-
mains onthebooks asacriminal of-
fense. However, there havebeenafew
cases, including one inIndiana, in
which anow-estranged wife insisted
that ahusband becharged with
sodomy forsexual acts while they
were living together. Traditionally
sodomy was called “acrime against
nature.” Sodomy doesnotinclude oral

speaking demurrer: n.anattempt to
introduce evidence during ahearing
onademurrer. Ademurrer isalegal
opposition toacomplaint inalaw-
suit(ortoananswer), which says, in
effect, thateven ifthefactual claims
(allegations) aretrue, there arelegal
flaws orfailures inthelawsuit.
Therefore, since thefactual allega-
tions areadmitted forthesake ofar-
gument, introducing evidence isim-
proper, andanattorney making a
“speaking demurrer” willbehalted,
often inmid-argument. Example: At-
torney Perry Pickwick filesademur-

medical malpractice, inwhich hear-
gues thatthesuitwas filed toolate
(after thetimeallowed bythestatute
oflimitations) since thecomplaint it-

stated that the plaintiff Elsa Ed-

special administrator: n.aperson
appointed bythecourt inaprobate
proceeding (management ofthees-
tate ofadeceased person) totake
charge oftheassets and/or investi-
gate thestatus oftheestate and
report tothecourt, usually when
there isadispute between benefi-
ciaries (those whomay receive
from theestate) andtheexecutor
oradministrator. (See:probate)
special appearance: n.therepre-
sentation byanattorney ofaper-
sonincourt for:a)onlythat par-
ticular session ofthecourt; b)on
behalf oftheclient’s regular attor-
neyofrecord; c)asafavor foran
unrepresented person; ord)pend-
ingadecision astowhether the
attorney agrees tohandle theper-
son’s case.Aspecial appearance is
different from a“general appear-
ance” inwhich theattorney is
committed torepresent theclient
inallfuture matters, hearings
and trial ofthecaseunless he/she
isallowed towithdraw orissub-
stituted “out of’thecasebythe
client. Quite often anattorney
willmake a“special appearance”

alappearance)
special circumstances: n.incrimi-
nalcases, particularly homicides, ac-
tions oftheaccused orthesituation
under which thecrime wascommit-
tedforwhich state statutes allow or
require imposition ofamore severe
punishment. “Special circumstances”
inmurder casesmay well result in
theimposition ofthedeath penalty
formurder (instates with capital
punishment) orlifesentence without
possibility ofparole. Such circum-
stances may include: rape, kidnap-
ping ormaiming prior tothekilling,
multiple deaths, killing apolice offi-
cerorprison guard, oractions show-
ingwanton disregard forlife,suchas
throwing abomb intoarestaurant.
(See: capital punishment)
special damages: n.damages claimed
and/or awarded inalawsuit which
were out-of-pocket costs directly as
theresult ofthebreach ofcontract,
negligence orother wrongful actby
thedefendant. Special damages can
include medical bills, repairs and re-
placement ofproperty, loss ofwages
and other damages which arenot
speculative orsubjective. They are
distinguished from general damages,
inwhich there isnoevidence ofaspe-
cific dollar figure. (See:damages,
general damages)
special master: n.aperson appointed
bythecourt tocarry outanorder of
thecourt, such asselling property or
mediating child custody cases.A“spe-
cial”master differs froma“master” in
that he/she takes positive action
rather them justinvestigating and re-
porting tothejudge. (See:master)

speculative damages
special prosecutor: n.anattorney
from outside ofthegovernment se-
lected bytheAttorney General or
Congress toinvestigate andpossibly
prosecute afederal government offi-
cial forwrongdoing inoffice. The
theory behind appointing aspecial
prosecutor isthatthere isabuilt-in
conflict ofinterest between theDe-
partment ofJustice and officials who
mayhave political orgovernmental
connections with thatdepartment.
Themost famous special pros-
ecutor waslawprofessor Archibald
Cox, originally chosen toinves-
tigate White House (and President
Richard Nixon’s) involvement inthe
Watergate scandal. President Nixon
demanded thatAttorney General
Elliot Richardson fireCox,whowas
being aggressive inhisinvestiga-
tion,andRichardson resigned rather
than comply, asdidAssistant Attor-
neyGeneral William Ruckelshaus.
Deputy Attorney General Robert
Bork finally discharged Cox.
special verdict: n.thejury’s deci-
sions orfindings offactwith theap-
plication ofthelawtothose facts left
uptothejudge, who willthen ren-
derthe final verdict. This type of
limited verdict isusedwhen the
legal issues tobeapplied arecom-
plex orrequire difficult computa-
tion. (See: specific finding)
specific bequest: n.thegiftinawill
ofacertain article toacertain per-
sonorpersons. Example: “Igivemy
diamond engagement ring tomy
niece, Sophie.” (See:bequest, will)
specific devise: n.thegiftinawillof
acertain piece ofrealestate toacer-
tainperson orpersons. Example: “Ileave theLazyZRanch tomybrother,
David.” (See: devise, will)
specific finding: n.adecision onafact
made byajury initsverdict and
which thejudge hasrequested the
jury todetermine aspart ofitsdelib-
erations. Often thejudge gives ajury
alistofdecisions onfindings offactto
bemade tohelpthejurors focusonthe
issues. Example: Findings: Wasdefen-
dantexceeding thespeed limit?—yes;
Wasdefendant negligent?—yes; Ifde-
fendant wasnegligent, wasthenegli-
gence aproximate cause ofdamages
todefendant?— yes;andsoforth. (See:
special verdict)
specific legacy: n.agiftinawillofa
certain article orproperty toacertain
person orpersons. (See: legacy, spe-
cificbequest, specific devise, will)
specific performance: n.theright ofa
party toacontract todemand thatthe
defendant (thepartywho itisclaimed
breached thecontract) beordered in
thejudgment toperform thecontract.
Specific performance maybeordered
instead of(orinaddition to)ajudg-
ment formoney ifthecontract can
stillbeperformed andmoney cannot

provision ofthe5thAmendment
(applied tothestates bythe14th
Amendment). Each state hasa
statute orconstitutional provision
limiting thetimeanaccused person
may beheld before trial (e.g.45
days). Charges must bedismissed
andthedefendant released ifthe

neighborhood zoned forsingle-family
dwellings withaminimum of10,000
square feet,thecomer service station
property iszoned commercial. Spot
zoning isnotfavored, since itsmacks
offavoritism andusually annoys
neighbors. Anexisting commercial
business canbeaccommodated bya
“zoning variance” (allowing anon-

standard ofcare: n.thewatchful-
ness, attention, caution and pru-
dence thatareasonable person in
thecircumstances would exercise. If
aperson’s actions donotmeet this
standard ofcare, then his/her acts
failtomeet thedutyofcarewhich allpeople (supposedly) havetoward oth-
ers.Failure tomeet thestandard is
negligence, andanydamages resulting
therefrom maybeclaimed inalawsuit
bytheinjured party. Theproblem is
thatthe“standard” isoften asubjec-

mous with unfairness and illegality
from thebench. Inmodem Ameri-
canhistory thebestexample ofstar
chamber proceedings wasthecon-
duct oftheHouse Un-American Ac-
tivities Committee (1938-1975),
which used itssubpena power toin-
timidate citizens byasking them
unconstitutional questions about
their political beliefs and associa-
tions, andthencharging them with
contempt ofCongress forrefusing to
answer. Another example wasthe
conduct ofcriminal proceedings
against black defendants insome
southern states from1876 until the
late1960s. (See:dueprocess, kan-
garoo court)
stare decisis:
(stah-ree duh-sigh-sis)
n.Latin for“tostand byadecision,”
thedoctrine that atrial court is
bound byappellate court decisions
(precedents) onalegal question
which israised inthelower court.
Reliance onsuch precedents isre-
quired oftrialcourts untilsuchtime
asanappellate court changes the
rule, forthe trial court cannot ig-
noretheprecedent (evenwhen the
trialjudge believes itis“bad law”).
(See: appellate court, lower

statement prior totheconference. In
federal courts thestatus conference
isalsotheoccasion forsetting atrial

statute: n.afederal orstate written
lawenacted bytheCongress or
state legislature, respectively. Local
statutes orlaws areusually called

statutory offer ofsettlement
statute offrauds: n.lawinevery
state which requires that certain
documents beinwriting, such as
realproperty titles andtransfers
(conveyances), leases formore
than ayear, willsandsome types
ofcontracts. The original statute
wasenacted inEngland in1677 to
prevent fraudulent title claims.
(See: contracts, deeds, fraud,
leases, wills)
statute oflimitations: n.alaw
which sets themaximum period
which onecanwait before filing a
lawsuit, depending onthetype of
case orclaim. Theperiods varyby
state. Federal statutes setthelimi-
tations forsuits filed infederal
courts. Ifthelawsuit orclaim isnot
filed before thestatutory deadline,
theright tosueormake aclaim is
forever dead (barred). Thetypes of
casesandstatute oflimitations pe-
riods arebroken down among: per-
sonal injury from negligence orin-
tentional wrongdoing, property
damage from negligence orinten-
tional wrongdoing, breach ofanoral
contract, breach ofawritten con-
tract, professional malpractice,
libel, slander, fraud, trespass, a
claim against agovernmental entity
(usually ashort time), andsome
other variations. Insome instances
astatute oflimitations canbeex-
tended (“tolled”) based ondelay in
discovery oftheinjury oronreason-
ablereliance onatrusted person (a
fiduciary orconfidential adviser who
hashidden his/her ownmisuse of
someone else’s funds orfailure to
pay).Aminor’s right tobring an
action forinjuries duetonegligence
istolled until theminor turns
18(except foraclaim against agovernmental agency). There arealso
statutes oflimitations onbringing
criminal charges, buthomicide gener-
allyhasnotime limitation onprosecu-
tion.Thelimitations (depending onthe
state) generally range from 1to6
years except forinRhode Island,
which uses10years forseveral causes
ofaction. Louisiana hasthestrictest
limitations, cutting offlawsuit rights
atoneyear foralmost alltypes ofcases
except contracts. California alsohas
short periods, usually oneyear, with
twoyears formost property damage
and oralcontracts andfouryears for
written contracts. There arealso
statutes oflimitations ontheright to
enforce ajudgment, ranging from five
to25years, depending onthestate.
Some states have special require-
ments before alawsuit canbefiled,
such asawritten warning toaphysi-
cianinaclaim ofmalpractice, making
ademand upon astate agency and
thenwaiting fortheclaim tobedenied
orignored foraparticular period, first
demanding aretraction before filing a
libel suit,andother variations. Ver-

ordeed oftrustwhen thenewowner
agrees totake titlewith therespon-
sibility tocontinue tomake the
394

subpena (subpoena)
payments onthepromissoiy note
secured bythemortgage ordeed of
trust. Thus, thenew owner
(grantee) buys theproperty “subject
to”secured debt. However, should
thenewowner failtopay,theorigi-
naldebtor willbeliable forthepay-
ment, buttheholder ofthemortgage
orbeneficiary ofthedeed oftrust
may foreclose andthebuyer could
thus lose title.This differs from the
new title holder “assuming” the
mortgage ordeed oftrustbyawrit-
tentransfer oftheobligation. Such a

subordination: n.allowing adebt or
claim which haspriority totake sec-
ond position behind another debt,particularly anew loan.Aproperty
owner with aloan secured bythe

subordination agreement,)
subordination agreement: n.awrit-
tencontract inwhich alender who
hassecured aloanbyamortgage or
deed oftrust agrees withtheproper-
tyowner tosubordinate thefirstloan

subpena duces tecum
both depositions (testimony under
oathtaken outside ofcourt) andat
trial.Subpenas areusually issued
automatically bythecourt clerkbut
must beserved personally onthe
party being summoned. Failure to
appear asrequired bythesubpena
canbepunished ascontempt of
court ifitappears theabsence was
intentional orwithout cause. (See:
contempt ofcourt, deposition,
subpena duces tecum, subpoe-
na,witness)
subpena duces tecum :(suh-pea-
nahdooh-chess-take-uhm ordooh-
kess-take-uhm): acourt order re-
quiring awitness tobring docu-
ments inthepossession orunder
thecontrol ofthewitness toacer-
tainplace atacertain time. This
subpena must beserved personally
ontheperson subpenaed. Itisthe
common way toobtain potentially
useful evidence, suchasdocuments
andbusiness records, inthepos-
session ofathird party.Asubpena
duces tecum must specify thedocu-
ments ortypes ofdocuments (e.g.
“profit andlossstatements ofABC

1995, allcorrespondence inregard
tothecontract between ABC Cor-
poration andMerritt”) oritwillbe
subject toanobjection thatthere-
quest is“toobroad andburden-
some.” Toobtain documents from
theopposing party, a“Request for

oradebthasbeen paid. Typically,
subrogation occurs when aninsur-
ancecompany which pays itsinsured

ligently builds abonfire which gets
outofcontrol andstarts agrass fire
which spreads toNed Neighbor’s
barn.GoodHands Insurance Co.has
insured thebam, paysNeighbor his
estimated cost ofreconstruction of
thebarn, andthen suesFarmer for
thatamount. Farmer willhave all
the“defenses” totheinsurance com-
pany’s suitthathewould havehad
against Neighbor, including thecon-
tention thatthecostofrepairing the
barnwas lessthan Neighbor was
paidorthatNeighbor negligently got
intheway offirefighters trying to
putoutthegrass fire. (See: negli-
gence, subrogee, subrogor)
subrogee: n.theperson orentity that
assumes thelegal right toattempt to
collect aclaim ofanother (subrogor)
inreturn forpaying theother’s ex-
penses ordebts which theother claims
against athird party.Asubrogee is
usually theinsurance company which
hasinsured theparty whose expenses
were paid. Thus, thesubrogee insur-
ancecompany may filealawsuit
against aparty which caused thedam-
ages toitsinsured which thesubrogee
paid. (See:subrogation, subrogor)
subrogor: n.aperson orentity that
396

substitution ofattorney
transfers his/her/its legal right to
collect aclaim toanother (subrogee)
inreturn forpayment ofthesubro-
gor’s expenses ordebts which
he/she/it claims. Thus, aperson in-
jured inanaccident (subrogor) is
paidbyhis/her/its owninsurance
company (subrogee) forthedam-
ages,andthen theinsurance com-
pany suesthepartywhoapparently

are15years, 10years and 10
years, respectively. Byimposing
successive sentences, thejudge

summary adjudication ofissues:
n.acourt order ruling that certain
factual issues arealready deter-
mined prior totrial. Thissummary
adjudication isbased upon amotion
byoneoftheparties contending
that these issues aresettled and
need notbetried. Themotion is
supported bydeclarations under
oath, excerpts from depositions
which areunder oath, admissions
offactbytheopposing party and
other discovery, aswellasalegal
argument (points and authorities).
Theother partymayrespond by
counter-declarations and legal ar-
guments attempting toshow that
these issues were “triable issues of
fact.” Ifthere isanyquestion asto
whether there isconflict onthe

thissummary process istoreduce

which willrequire evidence attrial

motion forsummary adjudication ofissues often accompanies thebroader
motion forsummary judgment, which
canresult injudgment ontheentire

forethetrial starts. Thepleading pro-
cedures areextremely technical and
complicated andareparticularly dan-

“temporary restraining order”
which isashort-term, stop-gap in-
junction issued pending ahearing,
atwhich timeatemporary injunc-
tionmaybeordered tobeinforce

temporary insanity: n.inacriminal
prosecution, adefense bytheaccused
thathe/she was briefly insane atthe
time thecrime wascommitted and
therefore was incapable ofknowing
thenature ofhis/her alleged criminal
act.Temporary insanity isclaimed asa
defense whether ornottheaccused is
mentally stable atthetime oftrial.
One difficulty withatemporary insan-
itydefense istheproblem ofproof,
sinceanyexamination bypsychiatrists
hadtobeafter thefact, sotheonly ev-
idence must betheconduct oftheac-
cused immediately before orafter the
crime. Itissimilar tothedefenses of
“diminished capacity” tounderstand
one’s own actions, the so-called
“Twinkie defense,” the“abuse excuse,”
“heat ofpassion” andother claims of
mental disturbance which raise the
issue ofcriminal intent based onmod-
empsychiatry and/or sociology. How-
ever,mental derangement atthetime
ofanabmpt crime, such asasudden
attack orcrime ofpassion, canbea
valid defense oratleastshow lack of
premeditation toreduce thedegree of
thecrime. (See: crime, defense, di-
minished capacity, insanity, in-
tent,Twinkie defense)
tenancy: n.theright tooccupy real
property permanently, foratime

tenancy atsufferance
atenancy may also bebased
onownership oftitle totheproper-
ty.(See: joint tenancy, landlord
andtenant, tenancy atsuffer-
ance, tenancy atwill,tenancy
bythe entirety, tenancy in
common, tenant, title)
tenancy atsufferance: n.a“hold-
over” tenancy after alease hasex-
pired butbefore thelandlord has
demanded that thetenant quit
(vacate) thepremises. During a
tenancy atsufferance thetenant is
bound bytheterms ofthelease (in-
cluding payment ofrent)which ex-
isted before itexpired. Theonly
difference between a“tenancy at
sufferance” anda“tenancy atwill”
isthatthelatter wascreated by
agreement. (See: landlord and
tenant, tenancy, tenancy at
will,unlawful detainer)
tenancy atwill: n.occupation ofreal
property owned byanother until
suchtime asthelandlord gives no-
ticeoftermination ofthetenancy

ownership. (See:community prop-
erty,tenancy)
tenancy incommon: n.title toproper-
ty(usually real property, but itcan
apply topersonal property) heldby
twoormore persons, inwhich each
hasan“undivided interest” inthe
property and allhaveanequal right to
usetheproperty even ifthepercent-
ageofinterests arenotequal orthe
living spaces aredifferent sizes. Un-
like ‘joint tenancy,” there isno“right
ofsurvivorship” ifoneofthetenants
incommon dies,andeach interest
maybeseparately sold,mortgaged or
willed toanother. Thus, unlike ajoint
tenancy interest, which passes auto-
matically tothesurvivor, upon the
death ofatenant incommon there
must beaprobate (court supervised
administration) oftheestate ofthede-
ceased totransfer theinterest (owner-
ship) inthetenancy incommon. (See:
joint tenancy, tenancy)

itis“grand theft” forlarger
amounts, designated misdemeanor
orfelony, respectively. Theft issyn-
onymous with “larceny.” Although
robbery (taking byforce), burglary
(taken byentering unlawfully) and
embezzlement (stealing fromanem-
ployer) areallcommonly thought of
astheft, they aredistinguished by
themeans andmethods usedand
areseparately designated asthose
types ofcrimes incriminal charges
and. statutory punishments. (See:

third party: n.aperson who isnota
party toacontract oratransaction,buthasaninvolvement (such asone
who isabuyer fromoneoftheparties,
waspresent when theagreement was
signed ormade anoffer thatwas re-

third-party beneficiary: n.aperson
who isnotaparty toacontract but

attheendof30days provide the
basis foralawsuit forunlawful de-

three strikes, you’re out: n.recent
(beginning 1994) legislation enacted
inseveral states (and proposed in
many others, aswellaspossible fed-
erallaw)which makes lifeterms (or
extremely longterms without parole)
mandatory forcriminals whohave
been convicted ofathird felony (asin
California) orofthree felonies involv-
ingviolence, rape, useofadeadly
weapon ormolestation. Theimpetus
for“three strikes, you’re out”has
come from public outrage overmur-
ders, assaults, rapes andchildmo-
lestations byreleased ex-convicts
with records ofrepeated violent
crimes. Concern hasbeen expressed
about theprovisions insome ofthe
billswhich prohibit pleabargaining
ofanycharged felony down toamis-
demeanor, denyanyjudicial discre-
tioninsentencing anddonotdistin-
guish between violent felonies and
cases ofnon-violent crimes which in-

time isoftheessence: n.aphrase
often used incontracts which ineffect
says: thespecified timeanddates in
thisagreement are vitalandthus
mandatory, and“wemean it.”There-
foreanydelay—reasonable ornot,
slight ornot—willbegrounds forcan-
celling theagreement. (See:contract)
timely: adj.within thetimerequired by
statute, court rules orcontract. Exam-
ple:anotice ofappeal isrequired tobe
filed within 60days oftheentry of
judgment, soanotice filedonthe61st
day isnot“timely.”
time served: n.theperiod acriminal
defendant hasbeen injail, often
while awaiting bailorawaiting trial.
Often ajudge willgiveadefendant
“credit fortime served,” particularly
when sentencing formisdemeanors.
Example: Johnny Jumpstart was ar-
rested fordrunk driving andspent
thenight injailbefore hewas re-
leased onhisownrecognizance. Since
theminimum sentence inhisstate
was48hours, thejudge willsentence
him tothat time, less14hours for
time served. After lengthy waits in
jailbefore trial, “time served” may
become veryimportant tothedefen-
dant. (See:sentence)

andrealproperty taxes due.Atitle re-
portmadewhen thereport isordered
iscalled a“preliminary report,” ora
“prelim,” andattime ofrecording an

thefinal titlereport. Thehistory ofthe
title iscalled an“abstract.” Atitle re-
port isprepared byatitlecompany, an
abstractor, anattorney oranescrow
company, depending onlocal practice.
Normally atitle report’s accuracy is
insured bytitleinsurance which will
require theinsurance company toei-

trust: n.anentity created tohold as-
sets forthebenefit ofcertain per-
sons orentities, with atrustee
managing thetrust(and often hold-
ing titleonbehalf ofthe trust).
Most trusts arefounded bytheper-
sons (called trustors, settlors and/or
donors) whoexecute awritten dec-
laration oftrust which establishes
thetrustand spells outtheterms
andconditions uponwhich itwillbe
conducted. The declaration also
names the original trustee or
trustees, successor trustees or
means tochoose future trustees.
Theassets ofthetrust areusually
given tothetrust bythecreators,
although assets may beadded by
others. During the lifeofthetrust,
profits and,sometimes, aportion of
theprincipal (called “corpus”) may
bedistributed tothebeneficiaries,
and atsome time inthefuture
(such asthedeath ofthe lasttrustor orsettlor) theremaining as-
sets willbedistributed tobeneficia-
ries.Atrustmaytake theplace ofa
willandavoid probate (management
ofanestate with court supervision)
byproviding fordistribution ofallas-
setsoriginally owned bythetrustors
orsettlors upon their death. There
arenumerous types oftrusts, includ-
ing“revocable trusts” created tohan-
dlethe trustors’ assets (with the
trustor acting asinitial trustee), often
called a“living trust” or“inter vivos
trust” which onlybecomes irrevocable
onthedeath ofthefirst trustor; “ir-
revocable trust,” which cannot be
changed atanytime; “charitable re-
mainder unitrust,” which provides for
eventual guaranteed distribution of
thecorpus (assets) tocharity, thus
gaining asubstantial tax benefit.
There are also court-decreed “con-
structive” and“resulting” trusts over
property held bysomeone for its
owner.A“testamentary trust” canbe
created byawill tomanage assets
given tobeneficiaries. (See: charita-
bleremainder trust, constructive
trust, declaration oftrust, inter
vivos trust, living trust, resulting
trust, settlor, testamentary trust,

facts”). Example: theevidentiary
factswere that driver Larry Lead-
foota)exceeded thespeed limit, b)
drove overthedouble-line, c)skid-
dedand lostcontrol ofhiscar;the
ultimate factwas, therefore, Lead-
footwasnegligent. Itisessential to
introduce theevidentiary facts dur-
ingthetrial inorder toprove theul-
timate fact.Amere statement bya
witness that “Leadfoot was negli-
gent” isnotsufficient, since itisan
opinion ofthewitness and isnotev-

clean hands,” theplaintiff’s complaint
willbedismissed ortheplaintiff will
bedenied judgment. Unclean hands is
acommon “affirmative defense” plead-
edbydefendants andmust beproved
bythedefendant. Example: Hank
Hardnose suesGrace Goodenough for
breach ofcontract forfailure topaythe

proves thatHardnose hadshown her
faked estimates from subcontractors to
justify hisoriginal bidtoGoodenough.

tracthad losttheability toexercise
his/her judgment andcould notrefuse
togive intothepressure. Evidence
ofsuchdominance ofanother’s mind

unfair competition
when thetestator andtheattorney
meet, are allevidence ofundue
pressure, andanimbalance or

venire: (ven-eer-ay) n.the listfrom
which jurors maybeselected. (See:
jury, panel)
venue: n.1)theproper ormost conve-
nient location fortrialofacase.Nor-
mally, thevenue inacriminal case is
thejudicial district orcounty where
thecrime wascommitted. For civil
cases, venue isusually thedistrict or
county which istheresidence ofa
principal defendant, where acon-
tractwasexecuted oristobeper-
formed, orwhere anaccident took
place. However, theparties may
agree toadifferent venue forconve-
nience (such aswhere most witness-
esarelocated). Sometimes alawsuit
isfiled inadistrict orcounty which
isnottheproper venue, and ifthe
defendant promptly objects (asks for
achange ofvenue), thecourt will
order transfer ofthecase tothe
proper venue. Example: apromisso-
rynote states thatanysuit forcol-
lection must befiled inWashington
County, Indiana, andthecase isfiled
inLake County, Indiana. Inhigh
profile criminal cases theoriginal
venue may beconsidered notthe
bestvenue duetopossible prejudice
stemming from pre-trial publicity in
thearea orpublic sentiment about
thecasewhich might impact upon
potential jurors. Forthese various
reasons either party toalawsuit or
prosecution maymove (ask) forachange ofvenue, which isuptothedis-
cretion ofajudge inthecourt where
thecaseorprosecution wasoriginally
filed.Venue isnottobeconfused with
“jurisdiction,” which establishes the
right tobring alawsuit (often any-
where within astate) whether ornot it
istheplace which isthemost conve-
nient orappropriate location. (See:
forum nonconveniens)
verdict: n.thedecision ofajury aftera
trial,which must beaccepted bythe
trialjudge tobefinal.Ajudgment bya
judge sitting without ajury isnota
verdict. A“special verdict” isadeci-
sionbythejuryonthefactual ques-
tions inthecase, leaving theapplica-
tionofthelaw tothose facts tothe
judge, whomakes thefinaljudgment.
A“directed verdict” isadecision fol-
lowing aninstruction bythejudge
thatthejurycanonlybring inaspe-
cific verdict (“based ontheevidence
youmust bring inaverdict of‘not
guilty”). A“chance verdict” (decided
bylotortheflipofacoin), a“compro-
mise verdict” (based onsome jurors
voting against their beliefs tobreak a
deadlock) anda“quotient verdict” (av-
eraging theamount eachjurorwants
toaward) areallimproper andwillre-
sultinamistrial (having theverdict
thrown outbythejudge) orbecause
forreversal ofthejudgment onap-
peal. (See:compromise verdict, di-
rected verdict, judgment, quo-
tient verdict, special verdict)
verification: n.thedeclaration under

vest: v.togiveanabsolute right to
title orownership, including real
property andpension rights. (See:
vested, vested remainder)
vested: adj.referring tohaving anab-
solute right ortitle,when previously
theholder oftheright ortitleonly
hadanexpectation. Example: after
20years ofemployment Larry
Loyal’s pension rights arenow vest-
ed.(See: vest,vested remainder)
vested remainder: n.theabsolute
right toreceive title after a
presently existing interest inreal
property terminates. A“vested re-
mainder” iscreated bydeed orbya
decree ofdistribution ofanestate
given bywill.Example: “Title to
theHard LuckRanch tomyson,
Sean, subject toalifeestate tomy
brother, Douglas.” Sean hasa
“vested remainder” which isanab-
solute right, Sean could selltoan-
other person atthistime, with oc-
cupancy delayed until titlewould
pass tohim. (See: vest, vested)
vexatious litigation: n.filing alaw-
suitwiththeknowledge that ithas
nolegal basis, with itspurpose to
bother, annoy, embarrass andcause
legal expenses tothedefendant.Vexatious litigation includes continu-
ingalawsuit after discovery ofthe
factsshows ithasabsolutely nomerit.
Upon judgment forthedefendant,
he/she hastheright tofileasuit for
“malicious prosecution” against the
original vexatious plaintiff. Moreover,
most states allow ajudge topenalize
with sanctions aplaintiff andhis/her
attorney forfiling orcontinuing a“friv-
olous” legal action (money award to
thedefendant forthetrouble and/or
attorney fees). (See: frivolous, mali-
cious prosecution, sanction)
vicarious liability: n.sometimes
called “imputed liability,” attachment
ofresponsibility toaperson forharm
ordamages caused byanother person

inalprosecution. Thus, anemployer of
anemployee who injures someone
through negligence while inthescope
ofemployment (doing work forthe
employer) isvicariously liable for
damages totheinjured person. In
most states aparticipant inacrime
(like ahold-up) maybevicariously li-
able formurder ifanother member of
thegroup shoots and killsashopkeep-
erorpoliceman. (See: felony mur-
der, liability, imputed liability)
vigilante: n.someone whotakes the
lawintohis/her ownhands bytrying
and/or punishing another person
without any legal authority. Inthe
1800s groups ofvigilantes dispensed
“frontier justice” byholding trials of
accused horsethieves, rustlers and
shooters, andthenpromptly hanging
theaccused if“convicted.” Amother
whoshoots thealleged molester ofher
child isavigilante.

necessarily void. (See:void)
void forvagueness: adj.referring
toastatute defining acrime which
issovague thatareasonable per-

vague statute isunconstitutional
onthebasis thatadefendant could
notdefend against acharge ofa
crime which he/she could notun-
derstand, andthuswould bede-
nied “due process” mandated by
the5thAmendment, applied tothe
states bythe14thAmendment.
(See:dueprocess)
voirdire:(vwahr [with anear-silent
“r”]deer) n.fromFrench “toseeto
speak,” thequestioning ofprospec-
tivejurors byajudge and attor-neys incourt. Voirdire isused tode-
termine ifanyjuror isbiased and/or
cannot dealwiththeissues fairly, or
ifthere iscause nottoallow ajuror
toserve (knowledge ofthefacts; ac-
quaintanceship with parties, wit-
nesses orattorneys; occupation
which might lead tobias; prejudice
against thedeath penalty; orprevi-
ousexperiences such ashaving been
sued inasimilar case). Actually one
oftheunspoken purposes ofthevoir
dire isfortheattorneys togetafeel
forthepersonalities andlikely views
ofthepeople onthejury panel. In
some courts thejudge asksmost of
thequestions, while inothers the
lawyers aregiven substantial lati-
tudeandtime toaskquestions.
Some jurors may bedismissed for
cause bythejudge, andtheattorneys
mayexcuse others in“peremptory”
challenges without stating anyrea-
son. 2)questions asked todetermine
thecompetence ofanalleged expert

absolute liability formedical cover-

evaluation oflimitation). Worker’s’Compensation Acts provide forasys-
temofhearings andquasi-judicial de-
terminations byadministrative law
judges andappeal boards. However, if

becomes theonlyremedy against an
employer anddoesnotinclude gener-
aldamages forpainand suffering.
Thus, aninjured worker maywaive
workers’ compensation andsuethe
employer fordamages caused bythe
employer’s negligence. Ifathird party

jured worker maysuethatparty for
damages eventhough he/she receives
